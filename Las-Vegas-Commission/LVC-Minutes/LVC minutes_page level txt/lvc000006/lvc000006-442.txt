A Special meeting of the Board of Commissioners held this l5th day of June, 1949 was
called to order at the hour of 4:45 P.M. by His Honor Mayor E. W. Cragin with the
following members present:	Commissioners Bunker, Moore, Peccole, Whipple, City Manager,

J. M. Murphy and City Clerk Shirley Ballinger. Absent:	City Attorney Howard W. Cannon.

The City of Las Vegas has encountered unanticipated emergency expenditures occurring on
and soon after the first of January, 1949, as follows:

1.	The purchase of Western Air Lines' leasehold interest and cost
of moving their gassing facilities in order that the Army Air Force

 could occupy exclusively and with unencumbered title the old
McCarren Field, a $45,000 outlay was made.

2.	Construction of the Charleston Boulevard underpass and storm
drain, rights of way for which were guaranteed by the City,

 required $30,000 in cash payments, plus $7,800 in addition for
payment for lateral drains installed by the City.

3.	An unprecedented winter damaged streets to an estimated $200,000
and emergency repairs had to be started soon after the first of the
year.

b. A requested emergency loan in the amount of $163,000 appearing as
 a budget item to balance estimated expenditures was reduced by the
State Board of Finance by $60,000 creating a greater fund shortage.

	5. A last quarter revenue deficiency in 1948 in the amount of

$51,000 depleted the City's carry-over funds.

6. An additional $30,000 necessitated by the passage by the State
 Legislature of a retirement act required City participation in the
amount of 5% of payrolls.

and, the foregoing emergency expenditures created an inability to pay for the Govern-
ment facilities covered under Project No. Nev. 26-ll6-F,

NOW, THEREFORE, be it moved by Commissioner Moore that the City of Las Vegas
hereby notifies the United States of America Federal Works Agency of cancellation of
the lease contract effective December 31, 1949, in accordance with terms of the
lease providing for termination at the end of any calendar year upon thirty days
notice. Further that the Mayor be directed to write a letter of transmittal to said
Federal Works Agency enclosing a certified copy of this motion, and offering a new
proposal.
