IN CONNECTION THEREWITH; PROVIDING A PENALTY FOR THE VIOLATION OF ANY OF THE PROVISIONS THEREOF; AND REPEALING

The Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas do ordain as follows:

Section 1. LICENSE REQUIRED. It shall be unlawful for a transient merchant, itinerant merchant
or itinerant vendor as defined in Section 2 of this ordinance to engage in such business within the City of
Las Vegas without first obtaining a license therefor in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance.

Section 2. DEFINITIONS. For the purpose of this ordinance a transient merchant, itinerant mer-
chant or itinerant vendor is defined as any person, firm or corporation, whether as owner, agent, consignee
or employee, whether a resident of the city or not, who engages in a temporary business of selling and deliv-
ering goods, wares and merchandise within said city, and who, in furtherance of such purpose, hires, leases,
uses or occupies any building, structure, motor vehicle, tent, railroad box car, or boat, public room in
hotels, lodging houses, apartments, shops, or any street, alley, or other place within the city, for the
exhibition and sale of such goods, wares and merchandise, either privately or at public auction provided
that such definition shall not be construed to include any person, firm, or corporation who, while occupying
such temporary location, does not sell from stock, but exhibits samples only for the purpose of securing
orders for future delivery only. The person, firm, or corporation so engaged shall not be relieved from
complying with the provisions of this ordinance merely by reason of associating temporarily with any local
dealer, trader, merchant or auctioneer, or by conducting such transient business in connection with, as a

Section 4. INVESTIGATION AND ISSUANCE. Upon receipt of such application, the City Clerk shall
cause such investigation of such person's or persons' business responsibility or moral character to be
made as he deems necessary to the protection of the public good. If, as a result of such investigation,
the applicant's character and business responsibility are found to be unsatisfactory, the application
