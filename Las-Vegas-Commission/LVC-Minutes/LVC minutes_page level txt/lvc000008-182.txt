SEWER AGREEMENT
Strip Hotels

Mr. R.J. Fitch was present at the meeting regarding his request for a 48 foot
driveway in front of his property at 105-107 St. Louis in order that his customers
can park off the street on the sidewalk area.

Commissioner Whipple stated that he was not in favor of this due to the fact that it
would set a presedent.

The City Attorney advised the Board that it would not be a violation to actually construct
the driveway, but the granting of the use of public right-of-way would be in violation
of their authority.

Discussion was held on this matter.

Commissioner Whipple moved this request be denied.

Bunker and Whipple voting aye; noes, Commissioner Jarrett and His Honor. Absent:
Commissioner Peccole.

at the next regular meeting.
