HON. E. P. CARVILLE
GOVERNOR

CARSON CITY, NEVADA

THE COMMISSIONERS OF LAS VEGAS AND MYSELF SUBMIT THE FOLLOWING FOR YOUR
CONSIDERATION WITH THE REQUEST THAT THE BILL PROVIDING FOR A TAX ON
GAMBLING RECENTLY PASSED BY THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY BE VETOED,

THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS IN 1944 RECEIVED REVENUE FROM GAMBLING AMOUNTING
TO $163,560.50 AND FROM LIQUOR $70,450.00, A TOTAL OF $244,000.00
AGAINST $142,000.00 FROM REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY TAXES. WITH REVENUE
FROM BOULDER DAM GONE AND BASIC DEMANDING A DRASTIC CUT COMBINED RATE
FOR SCHOOLS COUNTY AND CITY OVER FIVE DOLLAR LIMIT AND WE FACE A CUT.

TO BALANCE OUR BUDGET WE MUST AGAIN LOOK TO THE GAMBLING AND LIQUOR 

INTERESTS .

TO AMEND THE GAMBLING LAW IN THIS PARTICULAR WOULD BE THE FORERUNNER OF
LARGER LEVYS IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS AND WOULD EFFECT THE INCOME TO THIS
CITY AND OTHER CITIES IN THE STATE WHO HAVE COME TO DEPEND ON THIS
REVENUE FOR THEIR GROWTH. THIS MONEY BEING USED FOR SANITATION, FIRE
AND POLICE PROTECTION IN ADDITION TO CAPITOL OUTLAY AND BETTERMENTS.

NEVADA ADVERTISES ITSELF AS THE ONE SOUND STATE FREE FROM NUISANCE TAXES
AND TO COMMENCE TAXING ANY BUSINESS IS THE FORERUNNER TO SALES AND 

INCOME TAX.

THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS IS ON THE THRESHOLD OF EXTENSIVE INVESTMENTS FROM
OUTSIDE CAPITOL. TAXES AGAINST GROSS RECEIPTS HAS ALREADY MADE THE POT-
ENTIAL INVESTOR CAUTIOUS AND IN SOME INSTANCES PROPOSED PROJECTS HAVE
BEEN TEMPORARILY DISCONTINUED AWAITING OUTCOME OF THIS TAX LEGISLATION.

WE EARNESTLY REQUEST YOU GIVE THIS MATTER YOUR SERIOUS CONSIDERATION.
