for the issuance of building permits without first applying for a variance in each case.

provides less than 1750 square feet of land per family or dwelling unit in said R-3 classification.

SECTION 3. Upon passage of this ordinance, the Building Department shall issue the necessary permits
without requiring a variance, provided the plans of such construction are in accordance with any other
