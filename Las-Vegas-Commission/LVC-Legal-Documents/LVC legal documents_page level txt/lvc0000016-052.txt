THAT, for and in consideration of the sum of ONE and NO/100 Dollars ($1.00 ) and other good and 

valuable considerations, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and in 

consideration of the
mutual covenants, promises, and agreements herein made, the Licensor hereby grants to the Government a

(Type of installation) 



along, across, beneath, and over the right-of-way and property of the Licensor at the following location,

 viz:

in the County of Clark, State of Nevada, as shown on attached sketch marked Exhibit "A", for 

use in connection with a War Department establishment known as Las Vegas Gunnery School, Las Vegas,

 Nevada, and upon the following

(Name of post, camp, station, etc.)

terms, provisions, and conditions:

I. All installations placed upon said right-of-way by the Government shall be and remain the
property of the Government and may be removed therefrom by the Government at any time.

II. The construction, operation, maintenance, renewal, and removal of said installations shall
be accomplished by the Government at its sole cost and expense and in such a manner as will
at all times enable the Licensor to use the surface of the right-of-way.

III.	In the event of any future alterations of the property of the Licensor or of the line or

grade of the right-of-way necessitating changes in said installations, the Government will
make such changes in its installations as may be necessary in connection with said alterations.

IV.	The Licensor shall not be liable for damages to property or injuries to persons arising
from the construction, operation, maintenance, renewal, or removal of said installations
by the Government.

V.	This agreement, with the rights and privileges herein granted, shall be subject to 

cancellation or termination only by mutual agreement of the parties, or in the event the terms
and conditions hereof are not fulfilled, or in the event the Government abandons the use of
the premises for the purposes herein granted. In either of the latter two events, cancel-
lation may be effected by either party hereto upon thirty (30 ) days' written notice to the
other; and upon the expiration of said thirty (30) days after service of such notice, this
agreement and the rights and privileges hereby granted, as well as the obligations hereby
imposed upon the parties, shall absolutely cease and determine.

VI.	The Government hereby covenants and agrees that, on or before the termination of this license,

it will remove said installations and the appurtenances connected therewith from the premises	

of the Licensor and restore said premises to the condition existing at the time of entering
upon the same under this license, reasonable and ordinary wear and tear and damages by the
elements or by circumstances over which the Government has no control excepted.

VII.	All expenditures to be made by the Government under the provisions of this agreement shall
be subject to appropriations being available for the purpose.



VIII.	No member of or delegate to Congress or resident commissioner shall be admitted to any share
or part of this agreement or to any benefit to arise therefrom. Nothing, however, herein
contained shall be construed to extend to any incorporated company if the agreement be for
the general benefit of such corporation or company.

IX.	The Licensor warrants that he has not employed any person to solicit or secure this license
upon any agreement for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee. Breach of
this warranty shall give the Government the right to annul the license, or, in its discretion,

to deduct from the consideration the amount of such commission, percentage, brokerage, or
contingent fees. This warranty shall not apply to commissions payable by Licensors upon
licenses or contracts secured or made through bona fide established commercial or selling
agencies maintained by the Licensor for the purpose of securing business.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this agreement to be properly executed by their duly
authorized representatives as of the day and year first above written.
