GENERAL FUND BALANCE           City Manager Kennedy reported that the General Fund Balance as of June 15, 1959,

was $773,003.97, and that there were no refunds and no disbursements from Bond
Funds or Special Assessment Funds.

COUNTRY CHURCH	City Manager Kennedy advised the Board that an application had been received on May

DAY CENTER	26, 1959, from Reverend W. H. Higginbotham of the International Church of the Four

Square Gospel for a nursery license at the Country Church Day Center, 318 South
Nursery License Fee	11th Street.	Mr. Kennedy further advised	that no fee had been charged this nursery

Required	to date, and	it was being operated by the	Reverend's wife and a charge of $3.00

per day for each child was being made; all revenue going to the church fund.

Mr. Kennedy advised that there were certain establishments not required to pay the
regular nursery license fee; namely, the Variety Day School which is a true nonprofit 
operation with many people leaving their children there without charge, and
the other, the Jewish Community Center School which is not a true nursery because
of their educational program for which they have fully State accredited teachers
operating an educational type program.

Mr. Kennedy felt that in view of the fact that the Country Church Day Center did
charge a fee which went into the church treasury, it would be in direct competition
with commercial nurseries and believed the regular nursery license fee should be
required.

Commissioner Fountain moved that the regular nursery license fee for the Country
Church Day Center be required.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Elwell and carried by the following vote:	Commis-
