Discussion was held on the notification to the Liquor and Gaming licensees on the

a draft letter which was read to the Commission. The Board approved this letter and
requested that notification be sent to the casino operators.

Mr. Kennedy presented the proposal to increase fees charged at Woodlawn Cemetery. The
proposal was that lots priced at $50.00 be raised to $80.00; lots priced at $65.00 be
increased to $80.00; and lots presently selling for $80.00 remain at this price. He
further proposed that the County lots stay at $25.00, and baby plots be increased from
$15.00 to $25.00

The City Manager advised that with this increase in fees the anticipated income would
bring in approximately 80% of the funds required to operate the Cemetery.

Commissioner Sharp moved the City Manager's recommendation to increase the fees on
lots at Woodlawn Cemetery be approved, to be effective on July 1, 1956.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners
