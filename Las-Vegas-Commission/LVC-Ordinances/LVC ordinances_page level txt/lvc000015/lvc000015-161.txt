districts set forth herein, the Board of Commissioners has given due and careful consideration to the pecu-
liar suitability of each and every such district for the particular regulations applied thereto, the loca-
tion and extent of each district and the necessary proper and comprehensive groupings and arrangement of
the various uses and densities of population in accordance with a well considered plan for the develop-
ment of the city, and in desirable relation to established plans in adjoining municipalities and unincorp-
orated areas of the County of Clark.

The boundaries of such districts as are shown upon the map adopted by this article or amendments,
subsequent changes or supplements thereto, as are accomplished by the provisions of this article, are here-
by adopted and approved and the regulations of this article governing the use of land, buildings and stru-
ctures, the height of buildings and structures, building site areas, the sizes of yards about buildings
and structures, and other matters as hereinafter set forth, are hereby established and declared to be in
effect upon all land included within the boundaries of each and every district shown upon such map.

In the event that any land may, at the time of adoption of this article or at any time subsequent
thereto, be included within the corporate boundaries of the City, but shall not be delineated on the "Land
use plan" such land shall be automatically classified as in the R-A District; provided, however, that those
areas annexed to the City of Las Vegas which have been designated in a different zone than R-A by the for-
mer governing body of the annexed area, and which zone classification has been previously recommended by
the Regional Planning Commission, shall automatically be annexed with the corresponding zone classification
as that existing prior to the annexation.

SECTION 2. That by reason of the fact that large areas have recently been annexed to the City,
and zone changes of large parts of said area annexed must be made immediately so that the construction of
homes can be completed to alleviate the critical housing shortage, it is hereby declared that an emergency
exists, and that this ordinance is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
and safety.

SECTION 3. All ordinances and parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are hereby repealed.

SECTION 4. This ordinance shall be in effect on and after its passage, adoption, and publica-
tion thereof in the Las Vegas Sun, a daily newspaper published in the City of Las Vegas, for a period of
once a week for two consecutive weeks immediately following its first reading.
