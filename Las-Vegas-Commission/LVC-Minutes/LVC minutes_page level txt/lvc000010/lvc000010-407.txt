Attorney had contacted Judge Foley and it had been decided that if the City would
construct a fence around the property and present a bill to the Court it would be handled
as a preferred claim. Mr. Kennedy advised that this uncompleted building was very
hazardous and it was necessary to construct the fence so that someone would not get
hurt. He stated that the estimated cost of the fence was between $600 and $700.

Thereafter Commissioner Sharp moved the recommendation of the City Manager be accepted
and authorization granted to spend approximately $700.00 to construct a fence around
the Carver House.
