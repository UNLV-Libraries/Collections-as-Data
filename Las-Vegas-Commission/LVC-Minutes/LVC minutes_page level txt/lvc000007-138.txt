to go? These four men were the oldest men in the department. Should they not have had enough
experience and intelligence to disregard an invitation by a stranger whom they did not know, or ;
should they have consulted with their administrative head? It appears to me as an individual
that the Civil Service Board and certain members of the Police Department are more interested
in serving downtown political leaders than serving the City at large and paying all their
allegiance to the people of Las Vegas. The downtown people are further interested in appoint-
ing a Chief of Police. Why are they interested in appointing a Chief of Police, for their own
individual interests? Why shouldn't they be interested in allowing this Board to appoint the
Chief of Police? One reason the Board has failed to appoint a Police Chief previously is that
there is not enough courage among the members to appoint a Chief of Police who will serve all of
the people, and before the Chief of Police is selected in this City, I will divulge other in-
formation about people who are interested in appointing this Chief of Police unless a chief is
selected for the people. That's all I have to say.	

Commissioner Bunker: I have one statement I would like to make. I got a tremendous smile
out of the last paragraph of the Civil Service decision and I shall read it so you will all know
it: "It is the recommendation of the Board of Civil Service Trustees that immediate action be

taken by the City Commission of the City of Las Vegas to appoint a permanent Chief of Police,
and in so doing that they give particular attention to the qualifications of the man appointed
with respect to his length of experience, knowledge of police procedure and administrative ability
to insure against a repetition of a like situation and to re-establish the confidence of the
public in the police department at the earliest possible date." It is my opinion that if
J. Edgar Hoover had to work with the four men we sent back to work, and some of the others on the
department, even he could never re-establish the confidence of the people of Las Vegas in the
Police Department.

There being no further business to come before this special meeting, Commissioner
Bunker moved the meeting adjourn.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Moore and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Moore,. Peccole, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes,none.
