At this time the Board took under consideration the City Budget and tax levy for the
year 1925, and the matter was continued for further discussion at a regular adjourned meeting
to be held on Tuesday, the 17th day of February at the hour of seven thirty O'clock P.M.

At this time C.C. Boyer, Division Engineer of the Department of Highways of the
State of Nevada, presented to the Board the proposition of altering the original plan of con-
struction of the Federal Aid Highway through the City of Las Vegas, whereby the Willite surface
was to be laid over the present base, and stated to the Board that this plan did hot meet with
the approval of the Bureau of Public Roads; that said Bureau of Public Roads believed that un-
less the present base were removed the street when finished would be much too high. Thereupon,
after considerable discussion, it was ordered, upon motion of Commissioner Anderson, seconded
by Commissioner Matzdorf, that this Board enter into an agreement with the State Highway De-
partment to have the base removed, as above suggested, and it appearing to the Board that the
cost of the said proposed work to the City will be $3318.00, it was further ordered that this
Board shall make available for said work the above mentioned sum of $3318.00. Voting on said
Resolution Commissioners Anderson, Matzdorf, Elwell and His Honor the Mayor, W.C. German, Aye. Noes,
none.

	Thereupon the Board took under advisement the question of issuing an additional Four Thousand
($4,000.00) Dollars worth of bonds to meet the cost of the additional work decided upon in con-
nection with the construction of a Federal Aid Highway through the City of Las Vegas to con-
nect with route 6 of the State Highway system of the State of Nevada, it appearing to the Board
that the amount of money now remaining in the State Highway Fund is insufficient to cover the
cost of said proposed additional work, and it also appearing to the Board of City Commissioners
by an Act of the Legislature of the State of Nevada that the City Commissioners of the City
of Las Vegas have the authority to issue bonds in an amount not to exceed $50,000.00 for the
construction of a highway through the City of Las Vegas to connect with Route 6 of the State
Highway System under an act of the Legislature of the State of Nevada in convention assembled,
entitled, "An Act authorizing the Board of City Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, County
of Clark, to issue bonds to provide for the construction of a highway through said City of
Las Vegas, to connect with Route 6 of the State Highway system of the State of Nevada, and
providing for the ratification thereof by special or general election before the issuance of
any such bonds," approved March 5,1923, and

It further appearing to this Board that Thirty Four Thousand ($34,000.00) Dollars worth
of said authorized issue of bonds has been sold for the purpose above mentioned, and it also
appearing that the further sum of $3,318.00 is required for additional work in connection
with said construction, and it further appearing to the Board of City Commissioners that the
amount of money now remaining in the State Highway Fund of the said	City of Las Vegas	is

insufficient to meet	the cost of the additional work contemplated,
