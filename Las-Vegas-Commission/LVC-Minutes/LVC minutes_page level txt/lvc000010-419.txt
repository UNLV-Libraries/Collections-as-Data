Director and it was found that there were 31 protestants or 15% of the total number of
property owners who did not wish to be annexed.

or not he could continue to use his property as a yard to store the equipment he uses in
the well drilling business. He also asked whether or not he would have to have a city li-
cense if this property was annexed to the City. Mr. Barnett was informed that as long as
he did not do any business in the City he would not have to have a license.

protesting the annexation in the area could be contacted.
