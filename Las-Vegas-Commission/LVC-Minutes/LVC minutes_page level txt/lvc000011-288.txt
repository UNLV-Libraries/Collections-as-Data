LAS VEGAS DAY NURSERY         At this time His Honor Mayor Baker, requested the City Clerk to read the following letter
SCHOOL	dated January 2, 1959, which was addressed to City Manager Kennedy from Edward Young for

Request for purchase                or the Las Vegas Day Nursery School:
lease of City property

January 2, 1959

A. H. Kennedy, City Manager
City Hall
400 Stewart Avenue
Las Vegas, Nevada

Dear Mr. Kennedy:

In accordance with previous, conversations, request is made herewith on
behalf of the Las Vegas Day Nursery School, a non-profit Nevada corporation,
for 2½ acres, more or less, approximating ½ of the following described
property:

A certain tract or parcel of land lying and being within
the City of Las Vegas, County of Clark, State of Nevada,
and being a portion of the SE¼ of the NW¼ of Section 26
T20S, R61E, MDB&M - generally described as follows to-wit:

The N 411.56 ft. of the S 761.27 ft. of the E 574.81 ft.
of the SE¼ of the NW-y¼ of Section 26 - 20 61 MDB&M. Less
those portions reserved or dedicated for Public Right of
Way and Utilities purpose. Containing 5.15 acres, more
or less.

I sincerely regret any inconvenience or misunderstanding from failure to receive
our request before this. It had been my impression that such a request had been
sent.

Our organization has been established for the purpose of making available child
care facilities for pre-school and school age children of working parents. When
this land is made available to us on a long term lease or purchase arrangement,
we plan to undertake a campaign to raise funds through a joint effort of the 
interested parents and various community service organizations to construct facilities
suitable for this program.

We have not, as yet, had time to formulate any detailed campaign, as we had hoped,
until recently, that some single organization would undertake this construction
for us. However, there is no question as to the need for such a facility in this
city, and we feel certain that it will receive sufficient public support as to
enable us to start construction within some reasonable period of time.

We look forward to your early response.	Yours very truly

1-7-59	/s/ Edward Young
