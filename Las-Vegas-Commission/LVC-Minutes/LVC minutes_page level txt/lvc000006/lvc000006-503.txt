STATE OF NEVADA
CITY OF LAS VEGAS

To the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas:	I hereby certify

and report that the foregoing is the assessment roll, and assessment made by me
pursuant to an ordinance of the board of said city, adopted the 22nd day of July,

1949, for the purpose of paying that part of the cost which the board decided should
be paid and borne by special assessment for Street Lighting; Biltmore Addition,

Biltmore Addition Annex No. 1, and Biltmore Addition Annex No. 2. That in making
such assessment, I have, as near may be, and according to my best judgment, conformed
in all things to the directions contained in the ordinance of the board hereinbefore
referred to.

Dated_____Las Vegas_________, Nevada	August 18	A. D. 19	49 .

S/ M. C. Oglesby____________

Assessor

His Honor asked if there were any persons present who wished to object to this
assessment.

Thereafter discussion was held with property owners present relative to the cost of
this assessment district, the reasons for the period of time taken to make the assess-
ment, method of paying this assessment and the type of lights Installed.

There being no objections to this assessment, Commissioner Moore moved that the fore-
going Assessment Roll #5-1949 be approved.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Bunker, Moore, Peccole, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Mr. Oglesby explained to the group present that the yearly installment due on these
improvements would be collected in the first installment of taxes.
