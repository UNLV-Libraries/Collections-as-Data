#287	EMERGENCY RESOLUTION

($242,471.70), for Police Department salaries; and

WHEREAS, by reason of the large increase in the population of the City of Las Vegas,
the present personnel of the Police Department is inadequate to properly provide for the
public peace, welfare and safety; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners feel that it is absolutely necessary to immediately
employ ten (10) additional police officers; and

WHEREAS, the salaries of such additional police officers will amount to TWENTY

the year 1952 was prepared although due care and consideration was given; and

WHEREAS, by reason of the foregoing, a great necessity and emergency exists in con-
nection with the continued governmental operations of the City of Las Vegas, requiring the
immediate acquisition of the sum of TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLIARS ($25,000.00), to defray the
costs of such increase in personnel of the Police Department and the installation of new

sum of FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS, ($5,000.00), to the Sewer Maintenance Department; and

WHEREAS, it is the Judgment of the Board of City Commissioners of the City of Las

of events,
