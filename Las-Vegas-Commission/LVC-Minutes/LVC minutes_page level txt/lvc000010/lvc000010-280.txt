Commissioners Fountain and Whipple, committee for the recommendation on the proposed
rezoning ordinance requested additional time before reporting.

Commissioner Bunker, member of the committee for recommendation on the proposed ordi-
nance to increase the license fees on public utilities, made the following report and
requested that the same be made a part of the record:

"The committee had made a through investigation of the ordinance proposing to raise
license tax on public utilities and at this time wishes to make an interim report.
Investigation discloses that as far as the Power Company is concerned the City is
receiving a preferential rate which amounts to practically the same saving to the
City as an increased license fee to 2% would be. In addition, the Public Service
Commission in connection with the proposed increase in Sparks earlier this year, has
definitely gone on record as establishing a policy that it will permit public utili-
ties to pass an increase such as this, on to the consumer. This committee feels
that the consumer and the citizens of Las Vegas are already paying as much as they
can for utility services and we feel it would be unfair to the people of Las Vegas
to have this rate passed onto them, which it appears no doubt would be done.

'So far as the other two Utilities are concerned, we feel that additional time
should be given so that we can discuss an increase from the present rate to 1%.

We further recommend that a full Board serve as a committee when these two, the
Telephone Company and the Gas Company are called in, individually."
