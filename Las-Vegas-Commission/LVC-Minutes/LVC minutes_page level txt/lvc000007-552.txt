This bond and the interest thereon shall be payable from a special fund desig-
nated "Street Improvement Assessment District No. 100-6 Bond Interest and Redemption Fund,"
containing the receipts upon the collection thereof from the special assessments levied
against and secured by a lien upon property in Street Improvement Assessment District No.
100-6, which fund is and shall continue to constitute a sinking fund for and be deemed
specially appropriated to the full and prompt payment of said bonds and the interest
thereon, and shall be used for no other purpose whatever, provided, however, that in
the event said fund shall be insufficient to pay said bonds and the interest thereon
as they become due, the deficiency shall be paid out of the City’s general fund.

interest thereon, constitute a lien upon and against the property upon which such assess-

things essential to the validity of the bond exist, have happened and have been done
in due time, form and manner as required by law, and that the total issue of said im-

this bond, does not exceed the amount authorized by law nor the special assessments
levied to cover the cost of said improvements.

with reference, to making such improvements and levying the assessments to pay therefor,
have been regularly had and taken in compliance with law, and that all prerequisites
to the fixing of the assessment lien against the property benefited by the improvements
and of the personal liability of the owner or owners of such property therefor have been
performed.

absolute owner hereof for all purposes, and shall not be affected by any notice to the
contrary; (c) the principal of and the interest on this bond shall be paid, and this
bond and each of the coupons appertaining thereto are transferable, free from and with-
out regard to any equities between the obligor and the original or any. intermediate

charge to the obligor for the same.
