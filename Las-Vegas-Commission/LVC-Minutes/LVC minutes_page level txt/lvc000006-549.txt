RESOLUTION NO. 110

WHEREAS, the City of Las Vegas, like most communities in the United States, is
confronted with the problem of a serious housing shortage, and

WHEREAS, unlike most such communities in the United States, the housing needs of the
City of Las Vegas have been especially aggravated by its ever increasing population and
particularly by the War Department reactivation of the Las Vegas Army Air Field which will
bring several thousand Army personnel with their families into the City of Las Vegas seeking
home accommodations, and

WHEREAS, the building industry in the City of Las Vegas is making a prodigious effort
to provide the necessary housing to meet the present and ever increasing demand therefor,
and

WHEREAS, the successful and timely prosecution of the aforesaid building program
depends In large measure upon the expeditious consideration by the Federal Housing Admin-
istration of formal applications for building loans, and

WHEREAS, under the present organizational distribution of Federal Housing Adminis-
tration field offices, the needs of the entire State of Nevada are administered only by a
branch office in the City of Reno which is subsidiary to the main area office in San Francisco,
California, and

WHEREAS, all applications for loans to finance major housing construction projects
in the State of Nevada must first be filed with said branch office at the City of Reno for
preliminary consideration and then forwarded by said office to the main area office in San
Francisco, California, for further and final consideration and disposition, thereby entailing
an expanded period of time before such loans may be consummated and necessarily resulting in
the delay of essential construction, now, therefore, be it

RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, at a recessed regular
