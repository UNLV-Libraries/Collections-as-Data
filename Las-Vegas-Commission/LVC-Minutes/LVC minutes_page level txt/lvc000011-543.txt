FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT	City Manager Kennedy advised a report had been made up by Director of Public Works

Report and Letter to	Sauer, setting forth the recommendations of the Corps of Engineers for the development 

County Commissioners              of flood control adjacent to the City of Las Vegas. Mr. Kennedy further stated

he would forward this report by letter to Harley Harmon, Chairman, Clark County Board
Meeting to be Arranged               of Commissioners.

The estimated cost of this overall Flood Control Program would be $18,000,000.00;
the local district or area would be required to furnish approximately $4,000,000.00.

Mr. Kennedy suggested an overall bond issue of the district to obtain the necessary
funds and perhaps it could be handled in such a manner as an assessment district;
however, he added this was something that would have to be worked out.

After some discussion Mr. Kennedy was asked to inform the County Commissioners in
this letter that the Board of City Commissioners requested that prior to any additional
move on this District matter, a meeting be held between the City Commission and the
County Commission and they believed the other areas should be represented.
