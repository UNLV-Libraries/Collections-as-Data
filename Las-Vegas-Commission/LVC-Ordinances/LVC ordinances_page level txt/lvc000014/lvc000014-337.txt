ORDINANCE NO. 354

AN ORDINANCE RELATING TO TRAFFIC AND REGULATING THE USE OF THE STREETS AND HIGHWAYS OF THE
CITY OF LAS VEGAS; CREATING AND DEFINING PARKING METER ZONES; PROVIDING FOR THE DESIGNATION
OF INDIVIDUAL PARKING SPACES; DEFINING AND PROVIDING FOR THE INSTALLATION, OPERATION, AND
MAINTENANCE OF PARKING METERS: PRESCRIBING PARKING TIME LIMITS; REQUIRING DEPOSIT OF COINS
FOR THE USE OF PARKING METERS AND PARKING METER ZONES AND PROVIDING FOR THE COLLECTION AND
DISPOSITION OF SUCH COINS; PROVIDING FOR THE ENFORCEMENT THEREOF; DEFINING OFFENSES AND PRE-
SCRIBING PENALTIES; AND PROVIDING THAT INVALIDITY OF PART SHALT. NOT AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF
THE REMAINDER; AND REPEALING ALL ORDINANCES OR PARTS OF ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT HEREWITH.

WHEREAS, The narrowness of and the volume of traffic on the streets in certain sections
of the City of Las Vegas has the effect of congesting the streets and impeding the movement
of traffic; and

WHEREAS, It is the habit of numerous operators of motor vehicles to take advantage of
this situation by parking for unreasonably long periods of time in close proximity to other
motor vehicles so parked on the most congested parts of the city's busiest streets; and

WHEREAS, Such practice tends to further impede traffic and in addition thereto consti-
tutes a danger to the life, limb and property of other motorists, pedestrians and others; and

WHEREAS, It is the opinion of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas that
the best method by which the above mentioned conditions may be remedied is by the designation
of individual parking spaces in the said area, by restricting parking in said area to reason-
able intervals of time and by compelling the operators of vehicles who enjoy the use of the
parking space so designated to pay a portion of the cost of establishing, maintaining and re-
gulating the use of said parking spaces; and

WHEREAS, Previous attempts to regulate traffic and parking in the aforesaid area have not
been as successful as desirable for the reason that adequate policing of this problem by the
Police Department alone requires a larger number of officers for such work than can be spared
from other vital functions of the Police Department, and it is therefore desirable to employ
some mechanical assistance in the enforcement of said parking limitations; and

WHEREAS, Parking meters have been installed in a number of cities as an aid to the
police in reducing traffic difficulties and the public authorities of such cities report
favorable results from the installation and operation of parking meters;

NOW, THEREFORE, The Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas do ordain as follows:

Section 1. Definitions. For the purpose of this ordinance:

(a)	The word "vehicle" shall mean any device in, upon or by which any person or property
is or may be transported upon a highway, except a device which is operated upon rails or
tracks.

(b)	The word "streets" shall mean any public street, avenue, road, alley, highway,
lane, path, or other public place located in the City of Las Vegas and established for the
use of vehicles.

(c)	The word "person" shall mean and include any individual, firm, co-partnership,
association or corporation.

(d)	 The word "operator" shall mean and include every individual who shall operate a
vehicle as the owner thereof, or as the agent, employee or permittee of the owner, or is
in actual physical control of a vehicle.

(e)	The word "park" or "parking" shall mean the standing of a vehicle, whether occupied
or not, upon a street otherwise than temporarily for the purpose of, and while actually engaged
in, receiving or discharging passengers or loading or unloading merchandise or in obedience to
traffic regulations, signs or signals or an involuntary stopping of the vehicles by reason of
causes beyond the control of the operator of the vehicle.

(f)	The word "Parking Meter" shall mean and include any mechanical device or meter
not inconsistent with this ordinance placed or erected for the regulation of parking by
authority of this ordinance. Each parking meter installed shall indicate by proper legend the
legal parking time established by the city and when operated shall at all times indicate the
balance of legal parking time, and at the expiration of such period shall indicate illegal

or overtime parking.

(g)	The words "Parking Meter Zone" shall mean and include any restricted street upon
which parking meters are installed and in operation.
