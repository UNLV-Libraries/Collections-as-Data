 

4. On Saturday morning, I contacted W.P.B. relative to our application to
purchase one garbage dump truck and to check our certificates of War Necessity.

(a)	The application for permission to purchase one dump truck has been
forwarded to Washington, D.C. with approval recommended.

(b)	War Necessity Certificates have been audited with O.D.T. records
at Reno and certificates supplied for trucks not previously covered
by their records.

Amended Budget is now being typed for presentation to the Commissioners at tomorrow's
(9/7/44) meeting.

O.D.T. War Necessity Certificates covering our equipment not previously certified
were received today.

Dr. Hamer's invoice for the third quarter of 1943-4 (Period ending March 31, 1944)
was received this morning and is being processed.

Attached you will find a copy of the expenses involved in making this trip for your
approval.

Respectfully submitted
