The Director of Public Works reported to the Commission that they had analyzed the bid
of Goto Landscaping and Nursery Co. and that the bid was incomplete in that they had
submitted no bid on sidewalks, drinking fountains, curb and gravel.

After considerable discussion the Director of Public Works was instructed to contact
contractors or firms, to determine if we can negotiate to do the work omitted by the
Goto Landscaping and Nursery Co. and make a further check on the landscaping work to
see if the bid on that portion of the work is in line. After the above information
has been checked, if a definite recommendation is available within five to seven days,
the Commission would like to meet wo further consider the matter.

Mayor Baker stated that sometime ago, upon request, a committee composed of Commission's
Bunker and Fountain was designated to meet with a group regarding a youth program. Mayor
Baker further remarked that it appeared as though there were many groups and civic organ-
izations within the City who were in one way or another active or interested in a youth
program, that the formation of the P.A.L. organization of the Police Department was a-
nother step in the right direction. However, in his opinion, there was an apparent need
of the City to assume the responsibility of spearheading the organization of a coordinated
effort to develop a positive program that would result in definite steps being taken to
formulate a coordinated youth program. Mayor Baker then asked to hear from the Commit-
tee at this time.

Commissioner Bunker reported that the Committee had met with various groups and spent
a great deal of time studying and working on a youth program. He stated that he was
in complete accord with the remarks of the Mayor concerning the need for the City to
spear-head a positive coordinated program and reported that a meeting was scheduled for
Friday, March 29, 1957 to which representatives of groups who expressed an interest in
participating in such a program have been invited. He further stated that as a result
of this meeting, he hoped that a definite plan would be formulated to be presented to
the Mayor and Board of City Commissioners in the immediate future.

Commissioner Fountain moved the resignations of Gerald Stewart and Robert
Schmutzer as members of the Planning Commission be accepted and the Clerk
authorized to send a letter of appreciation for the service they have ren-
dered to the City as members of that Commission.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes,
none. Absent:	Commissioner Sharp.
