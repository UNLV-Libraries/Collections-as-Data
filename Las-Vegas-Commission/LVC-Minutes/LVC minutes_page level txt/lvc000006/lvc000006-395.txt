March 23, 1949

A recessed regular meeting of the Board of Commissioners held this 23rd day of March, 1949

following members present:	Commissioners Baskin, Clark, Moore, Whipple; City Manager

J. M. Murphy and City Clerk, Shirley Ballinger. Absent:	City Attorney C. Norman Cornwall.

BID ON SEWAGE PLANT This being the time for the award of the bid for the construction of the proposed Sewage
CONSTRUCTION	Treatment Plant, His Honor Mayor Cragin explained that since the voters had voted a Bond

Issue of $350,000.00 and the lowest bid made was no where near that amount, the bid can-
not be awarded at this time. The Board will take a period of time for consideration and
attempt to negotiate with the Government for the purchase of the existing Sewage Plant
	in the hope that there will be sufficient money left to make up for the deficiency for the

construction of the new plant. Since there is a thirty day period of grace allowed, some
sort of action will be taken within this time. Since the two low bidders were Fitzgerald
Construction Company and Hoagland-Findlay Company, all other bids were rejected and the
City Clerk instructed to return the bid bonds of these firms.

BID ON SALE OF CITY This being the time set for the award of the bid on the sale of City property, Commissioner
PROPERTY	Clark moved that all bids received on March 22, 1949 be rejected and the City Clerk

instructed to return said bids and the $% deposit included.



Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Baskin, Clark, Moore, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Mr. Thomas A. Campbell asked if the Board would set an estimate on the amount that would
be acceptable for the sale of this property.

His Honor, speaking for the Board, stated that it was their opinion that this land was worth
at least $50,000.00. His Honor also said that the Board would be willing to readvertise if
some bidder would indicate willingness to bid.

There being no further business to come before the meeting at this time, the meeting adjourned.
