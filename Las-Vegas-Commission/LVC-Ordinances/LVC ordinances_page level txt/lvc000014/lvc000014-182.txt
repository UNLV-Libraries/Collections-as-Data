housing areas" by the War Production Board is eligible for priority assistance under preference
rating orders issued by the War Production Board, but only for the materials and products
listed in said "Defense Housing Critical List" and only in much limited quantities and for such
limited uses as are therein specified; and

secure the construction of essential housing for defense workers and others; and

cution of the war effort, now therefore, in the interest of national defense and as a war
emergency measure, NOW THEREFORE,

be granted for defense housing construction although the drawings and specifications there-
for do not conform to the requirements of the building code insofar as said code relates to
the use of critical material, subject to the following terms and conditions:

(a)	In all cases where the building code requires the use of a critical material for a
particular construction purpose and the use of such material for that purpose is not per-
mitted by the Defense Housing Critical List, there may be substituted therefor such materials,
and in such quantities, as are specified in or limited by the Defense Housing Critical List;
Provided, That where the Defense Housing Critical List allows a choice of materials for a
particular construction purpose, the building official within his discretion may determine
which alternate material shall be used.

(b) In cases where the building code requires a critical material for a particular con-
struction purpose and where the same or another critical material is not eligible for such
purpose under the Defense Housing Critical List, the building official may permit the use

of any non-critical material which will, in his opinion, provide the best available substitute.

(c)	Nothing herein shall be construed to authorize the granting of a building permit for any
proposed construction not conforming in all respects to the requirements of the building code
if the building official finds that such proposed construction will create a nuisance or will
endanger public health, safety and welfare: Provided, That such findings shall be reduced

to writing and shall be recorded and filed with the City Clerk, subject to public inspection
at all times said Clerk's office is open to the public.
