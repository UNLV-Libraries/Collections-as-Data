Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Fountain, Sharp and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes, none.
Absent:	Mayor C. D. Baker.

REZONING (Z-10-59)               The Commission considered the application of M. S. McCoy for the reclassification of
M. S. McCoy	property located at the northeast comer of West Charleston and Rancho Road from R-E

to C-1.

Approved

Planning Director Bills advised that there were eight protests and approximately 
fifty-three in favor of this rezoning. Mr. Bills advised further that a special committee
from the Planning Commission had studied and investigated this rezoning and it was
the recommendation of the Planning Commission that it be approved subject to the
following conditions:

1.	That the property be used strictly for the proposed use of a drive-in
branch bank.

2.	That the building conform to all City Ordinances and building codes
including setbacks, landscaping, signs, traffic and parking facilities, 
etc.

His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple asked if there was anyone present who wished to
protest this rezoning and Mr. Murle Perry, 2318 Sherman Place, presented the Board
a petition in protest, stating that it was his opinion this area should be strictly
residential. He said that he lived in the McNeil Tract adjacent to the property in
question and he received notice of this proposed rezoning.

Commissioner Fountain asked Planning Director Bills if the favorable petitions were
on file and he replied that there was a petition, some letters, and also personal
appearances in favor, totalling 53 in all.

Mrs. Stephanie Hurley spoke in protest and was of the opinion that many signed the
petition in favor of this rezoning thinking it was against making this commercial.

She added that this was a most unrealistic approach in dropping from R-E to C-1 and
stated that this corner was most dangerous. She referred to many recent rezonings
which might be all right as they now stand but thought the zoning ordinance should
be upheld when surrounding property is affected and certain rezoning applications
should be denied on the grounds that they are not in the public interest.

Mr. Perry again spoke to the Board in regard to procuring enough signers to reject
a rezoning such as this as the signers he had on the petition he presented to the
Commission were from his block only, but that with adequate time he believed he
could get signers all the way to Westleigh.

Mr. Art Ham, Jr., attorney for the Bank of Nevada who now has the property in
question in escrow, spoke, to the Commission stating that he believed this was 
exaggerated. He further stated that Mrs. Hurley's protest had been heard by the
Planning Commission and yet this application had been approved unanimously. He
believed that what they were afraid of was subsequent rezonings. He added that the
33 in favor were voluntary signatures from people who want the bank there, and that
rather than a hazard this rezoning would take away a traffic problem in that the
use would be limited to that of a drive-in bank. He stated that there were some
people who wanted all of Charleston zoned Commercial and some that wanted none of
it zoned Commercial, but stated he was sure the City Commission and Planning 
Commission would give appropriate protection to the residents in the area.

Mrs. Hurley mentioned that the signatures in favor of this particular rezoning were
signed by people that want all of Charleston Commercial. She added that this
