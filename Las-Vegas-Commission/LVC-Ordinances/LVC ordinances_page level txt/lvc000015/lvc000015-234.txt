validity of the bond exist, have happened and have been done in due time, form and manner as required by

expenses, including this bond, does not exceed the amount authorized by law nor the special assessments
levied to cover the cost of said improvements.

It is hereby further certified, recited and declared that the proceedings, with reference to making
such improvements and levying the assessments to pay therefor, have been regularly had and taken in compliance
with law, and that all prerequisites to the fixing of the assessment lien against the property benefited by
the improvements and of the personal liability of the owner or owners of such property therefor have been
performed.

This bond is subject to the condition, and every holder hereof by accepting the same agrees with the 
obligor and every subsequent holder hereof, that (a) the delivery of this bond to the transferee shall vest
title in this bond and in the interest coupons attached hereto in such transferee to the same extent for all
purposes as would the delivery under like circumstances of any negotiable instrument payable to bearer; (b)
the obligor and any agent of the obligor may treat the bearer of this bond as the absolute owner hereof for
all purposes, and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary; (c) the principal of and the interest
on this bond shall be paid, and this bond and each of the coupons appertaining thereto are transferable, free
from and without regard to any equities between the obligor and the original or any intermediate holder hereof,
or any set-offs or cross-claims; and (d) the surrender to the obligor or any agent of the obligor of this bond
and each of the coupons shall be a good discharge to the obligor for the same.
