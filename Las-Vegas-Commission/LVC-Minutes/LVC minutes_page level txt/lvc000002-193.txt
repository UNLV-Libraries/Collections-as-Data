RESOLUTION

Whereas, at the August, 1925 meeting of the Clark County
Board of Equalization an order was made and entered by said
Board reducing the assessed valuation of vacant and unoc-
cupied lands within the City limits (other than town lots and
enclosed and cultivated farm lands) from a classification and
valuation of 2nd class Arable at $20 per acre to 3rd class
Arable at $10.00 per acre, and

Whereas, said reduction was made without notice to or
consultation with the Board of City Commissioners of the
City of Las Vegas, or any of the officers thereof and reduces
the assessed valuation within said City of Las Vegas in
approximately the sum of $100,000 and also reduces the
tax receipts approximately the sum of $4,000, and

Whereas, the said classification as 2nd class arable
has been in force for many years and mo apparent good
reason exists for the reduction of the same to 3rd class arable
and

Whereas the majority of said lands are held for specula-
tion and have a speculative value from $50 to $400 per acre, and
none of the same can be bought for less than $50 per acre, and

Whereas, the largest amount of said land is held and owned
by Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad Company (Union Pacific
System) or its subsidiary Las Vegas Land & Water Company and
which said owner has been content to pay taxes upon said
former valuation and classification as 2nd arable at $20.00
per acre, and

Whereas, in the opinion of the Board of Commissioners of the
City of Las Vegas the said reduction is based upon principles
that are not just and equitable, and such reduction is inimical
to the interests of the City of Las Vegas,

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that application be made to
the Nevada State Board of Equalization at its meeting to be
held in September, 1925 for the raising of said valuations,
so reduced, back to $20.00 per acre, and the classification of
said land as 2nd class arable instead of 3rd class arable;

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this Resolution,
certified by the Mayor and City Clerk the transmitted to said
State Board of Equalization as and for the application afore-
said, and that there be also furnished to said State Board of
Equalization a list of the said lands affected by the order
aforesaid and concerning which the restoration of said 
valuation and classification is desired as hereinabove set forth.

There being no further business to come before the Board at this time it was moved

moved by Commissioner Smith seconded by Commissioner Mundy that the Board adjourn until their next

regular meeting held on the 1st day of October, A.D. 1925. Vote as follows: Commissioners Smith,
