CONNIE MORMON	City	Attorney Cory advised the	Board that a letter from the Child Welfare Board had

NURSERY LICENSES	been	received requesting the licenses of Connie Mormon to operate child care nurseries 

be revoked on grounds as listed in said letter. Mr. Cory advised further that
Show Cause Order	City	Ordinance required Public	Hearing to be held at such time as determined by the

Issued	City	Commission, at which time	the licensee would be allowed to show cause, if any

she had, why her licenses to operate child care nurseries should not be revoked and
might present a reasonable number of witnesses as the Commission deemed relevant.

Commissioner Sharp moved that Connie Mormon be cited to appear at a Call of a Special
Meeting of the City Commission at 8:00 p.m., July 22, 1959, in the Council Chambers
at the City Hall to show cause why her nursery licenses should not be revoked by
reasons stated by the Child Welfare Board in their letter, said reasons to be
included in the citation.

INTERIM MUNICIPAL JUDGES        City Attorney Calvin Cory stated the interim judges serving during the temporary
COMPENSATION	absence of Municipal Judge Richards had requested compensation for their services

but did not wish the same deducted from the regular salary of Judge Richards. Mr.

Resolution Adopted Cory further stated Judge Richards had been authorized to attend the National

Conference of Traffic Court Judges in Denver, Colorado, to be absent for five days.

He continued that the City Charter empowers the City Commission to provide for
compensation for those who serve during such an absence and recommended that a 
resolution be adopted authorizing payment for the interim judges who serve during an
absence of the Municipal Judge which has been authorized by the City Commission.

Commissioner Fountain moved the following resolution be adopted and order made:

RESOLUTION

RESOLVED that the Board of City Commissioners hereby authorizes payment of
compensation to be made to each judge who serves temporarily during the authorized
absence of Municipal Judge Richards, to be paid directly to the said interim judges
upon receipt of bill therefor for each day said judge so serves, not to exceed, however, 
a total in all of five (5) days with said compensation to be based upon the
then current salary of the Municipal Judge.

PASSED, ADOPTED AND APPROVED this 1st day of July, 1959.
