SERVICE & MATERIAL
WARRANTS

TRAFFIC COMMISSION
Off-Street Parking

Commissioner Jarrett moved that Service & Material Warrant No. 53339 in the total
amount of $4,954.00 be approved and the Mayor and Clerk authorized to sign same.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Jarrett, Sharp, and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent:
Commissioners Bunker and Whipple.

At this time Mayor Baker turned over the meeting to Mr. James L. Young, Chairman
of the Traffic Commission.

Mr. Young stated that the Traffic Commission would like to request that a certain
percent of the parking meter money be set aside for off-street parking purposes and
suggested the amount of 7$ per cent. Mr. Young also requested that the existing
ordinance be amended to allow the use of this money for off-street parking purposes.

Discussion followed. Mr. Herb McDonald of the Chamber of Commerce asked if it was
true that $100,000 had been set aside by the City for parking purposes. Mayor
Baker answered that this amount had been earmarked from the sale of the City's
strip property, but had not been used due to the fact that there had been no land
available at this price.

Commissioner Sharp suggested the possibility of selling Revenue Bonds to secure
enough money to install off-street parking lots. Mr. Franklin Bills, Planning
Director, outlined the bad points to securing money through Revenue Bonds.

There being no further business to come before the Board, the meeting adjourned.
