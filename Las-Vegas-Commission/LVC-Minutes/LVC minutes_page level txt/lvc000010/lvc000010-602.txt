is proceeding, the plant will not be completed before the 1st of December, 1957*

notified in writing that if additional time for completion is required that they will
have to pay the cost for the services of the Consulting Engineers.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	Commis-

sioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.
