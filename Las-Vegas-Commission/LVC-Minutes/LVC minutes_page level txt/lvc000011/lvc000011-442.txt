Commissioner Fountain moved that the charges as set forth in the Show Cause
order issued April 3, 1959, be dismissed at this time without prejudice as
recommended by the City Attorney.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Fountain; Sharp and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes;
none. Absent:	Mayor C. D. Baker.

PETITION	His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple presented a petition to the Board signed by 

Charles and Ann Connery	residents in the vicinity of East Ogden and Harley Way protesting the condition of

1601 Ogden Ave.	property at 1601 Ogden Avenue; occupied by the Charles Connery family, which 

mentions the fact that City Forces have tried several times during the past four or
Notice to be served	five years to correct these conditions without any lasting success. Mayor Pro

Tem Whipple suggested more stringent measures be taken and that the occupants be
informed to keep the property cleaned up or cite them into Court.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple asked if anyone was present representing the owners of the
property and City Manager Kennedy informed the Board that the owners live in
Wyoming and that Mr. and Mrs. Connery, who reside there, were presently out of
town as they had to take their little girl to the City of Hope for a heart operation. 
He added that someone had cleaned the place up a little and that some of
the neighbors had offered to help but were turned down.

Commissioner Fountain moved that Mr. and Mrs. Charles Connery, 1601 Ogden Avenue,
be served notice that unless the property is cleaned up within 24 hours after
being served with notice they would be cited into court under provisions of City
Ordinance.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Fountain, Sharp and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes,
none. Absent:	Mayor C. D. Baker.

Mr. Earl Bohne spoke from the audience stating that he wished to clarify certain
statements made in the paper and that there had been no threats; merely this 
petition to help the property owners in the area rectify this situation. He was of
the opinion that all had been very tolerant requested help from the various 
departments rather than quarrel over the back fence. He stated further that they were
appreciative of the problems of this large family, but that as time went by 
conditions grew worse and worse until one by one neighbors called for assistance from
the City Departments who in turn notified these occupants and they promised 
cooperation but this did not last. He added that they, as neighbors, still tried to
be of assistance to the family but it was received with a shrug of the shoulders.

Mr. Bohne continued that unfortunately, when they started this action, they did not
know the child was being operated on at the City of Hope on this day; however, he
still felt that this presents a serious problem and for the health of their own
children, should be eliminated. He concluded with the statement that they had a
list of violations but did not feel it necessary to enumerate them here as they
were sure the Commission knew what needed to be done.

EMERGENCY ORDINANCE NO. 794            City Attorney Calvin Cory advised the Board that it would be necessary to adopt
Amendment to Emergency	Emergency Ordinance No. 794 amending Emergency Ordinance No. 788 Creating 

Ordinance No. 788 Creating	Assessment District 100-43, Street Lighting on Main Street from Bonanza to Owens. He

Assessment District No.	stated further that the City Charter requires the Mayor and three members of the

100-43	Commission, or at least four Commissioners, to vote on all measures on the levying

of taxes; therefore, notices cannot be sent out as originally provided in Emergency
Adopted	Ordinance No. 788, and the purpose of this amendment is to extend the sending of

notices beyond the City's General Election to be held June 2, 1959, so this requirement
 can be met:
