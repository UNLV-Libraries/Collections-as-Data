	RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, by Order of the Board of Commissioners a notice was published on the 20th day
of February, 1949, in the Las Vegas Evening Review Journal a daily newspaper of general
circulation printed and published in Las Vegas, in the County of Clark, State of Nevada, of
the intention of the Board to Act upon a resolution reciting the character of the necessity
for and authorizing a temporary emergency loan in the sum of One Hundred Sixty-three Thousand
	Eight Hundred Twenty-eight and 6l/lOOths Dollars ($163,828.61) for the purpose of securing

funds to meet certain accrued and binding indebtednesses and obligations, and necessary
expenditures of the City of Las Vegas, and

WHEREAS, said Board has duly met this day, the 17th day of March, 1949, for the
purpose of acting upon said resolution, and

WHEREAS, no other meeting for the purpose of acting upon said resolution was held by
said Board within the period of fifteen days subsequent to the publication of the afore-
said notice of intention, and no action upon said resolution was held by said Board within
said fifteen day period, and

WHEREAS, no objections by the public, or otherwise, have been made at this meeting of
the Board of Commissioners held this 17th day of March, 1949, or at any time prior thereto,
to the adoption by said Board of said resolution for an emergency loan, and

WHEREAS, the Budget of the City of Las Vegas for the year 1948 included an item of anti-
cipated revenue in the sum of One Hundred and Twenty Thousand Dollars ($120,000) which
consisted of the proceeds of a proposed emergency loan to be made during said budget year, and

WHEREAS, said Budget for the year 1948 was approved by the State Board of Finance of
the State of Nevada, and

WHEREAS, the anticipated expenditures set forth in said Budget were based upon the
reasonable expectation of the full receipt of the anticipated revenues set forth in said
Budget, and

WHEREAS, by reason of a program of further retrenchment and more rigid economic
administration of governmental operations, after the approval of the 191*8 Budget as afore-
said, it was reasonably expected that the anticipated revenues would provide sufficient
funds, without the need for the aforesaid emergency loan, to meet the anticipated expenditures
set forth in said Budget, and

WHEREAS , by reason thereof, no action was taken for the acquisition of said sum of
One Hundred Twenty Thousand Dollars ($l20,000) by an emergency loan, and said sum was not
acquired, and

WHEREAS, at the end of said budget year of 1948 there developed a deficiency in the
receipt of anticipated revenues to the extent of Fifty-one Thousand Three Hundred Forty-
nine and Seventy-nine/100th Dollars ($5l,349.79), consisting of a deficiency of Eighteen Thousand
Five Hundred Twenty-one and 18/l00ths Dollars ($18,521.18) in tax collections, and Thirty-
two Thousand Eight Hundred and Twenty-eight and 6l/100ths Dollars ($32,828.6l) in non-tax
revenues, and

WHEREAS, the City of Las Vegas has incurred a necessary debt in the sum of Forty-five
Thousand Dollars ($45,000) in connection with the surrender of the lease of the Western Air
Lines, Inc. covering the Municipal Airport, and the removal of tanks and gasing facilities
from the Municipal Airport to the Clark County Airport, which is an accrued indebtedness
and binding obligation of said City, and

WHEREAS, the City of Las Vegas has incurred a further indebtedness in the sum of
Seven Thousand One Hundred Eighty-one and 96/lOOths Dollars ($7,181.96) to defray the
necessary construction costs over and above the sum made available therefor by bond issue
for the completion of the storm drainage project of said city, which is an accrued indebted-
ness and binding obligation of said city, and

WHEREAS, the recent unprecedented snow storms caused considerable damage to the streets
and other public ways of the City of Las Vegas, creating therein conditions dangerous to
vehicular and pedestrian traffic which necessitates the immediate expenditure of the sum of
Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000) for repairs, and

WHEREAS, the anticipated revenues of the City of Las Vegas for the year 1949 are
inadequate to meet the aforesaid indebtedness and obligations, and necessary expenditures,
in addition to the current necessary general operating expenses, and

WHEREAS, by reason of the foregoing, a great necessity and emergency exists in connection
with the continued governmental operations of the City of Las Vegas, requiring the immediate
acquisition of the sum of One Hundred Sixty-Three Thousand Eight Hundred Twenty-eight and
6l/100ths Dollars (l63,828.6l) to defray the costs of such continued operations, now, there-
fore, be it
