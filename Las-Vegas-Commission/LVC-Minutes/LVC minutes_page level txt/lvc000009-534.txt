At this time Mr. Paul Funk appeared before the Commission concerning the status of the
package liquor license of the Downtown Liquor Store. Mr. Funk explained that he was a
stockholder of the Thrifty Grill Inc. and requested that the Board give consideration to
their application for this license, formerly issued to Thrifty Grill Inc. and the First
National Bank as Executors of the Estate of Ethel Rapaport. Mr. Funk claimed that it
was his understanding that the only reason the Estate had remained on the license was
due to the fact that it had the lease of the building located at 28 Fremont, which is
now being demolished.

Thereafter Commissioner Bunker moved that this matter be referred to the City Attorney
for investigation and report back to the Commission.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
