Mr. Dick King, Printer, appeared before the Board relative to a motion made on June 7,
1943 requiring a union label on all printing done for the City, Mr. King explained
to the Board that it is impossible for him to obtain a union label since he has a
"one-man shop".

Thereafter Commissioner Moore moved that the motion of June 7, 1943 requiring union
labels on all printing done for the City be amended to exclude this requirement of
"one-man shops".

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following votes Commissioners
Bunker, Moore, Peccole, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

At this time a report from the Planning Engineer relative to the Transformer located at
      10th & Charleston was read to the Board, stating that the Transformer was installed
without a Building Permit and in violation of the Zoning ordinance.

Commissioner Bunker moved that the Southern Nevada Power Company be notified to appear
before the Board to show cause why this Transformer should not be removed.

The following members of the Advisory Board were present at the meeting to discuss the
request of Wilbur Clark to connect his Desert Inn Hotel to the City sewer:

George Franklin, Sr.	Robert Kaltenborn

Mike Gordon	Lorin Ronnow

Ralph Hensinger	J. A. Tiberti

Discussion was held and the Advisory Board suggested that the City enter into an agree-
ment with all the hotels obtaining sewer service that are located outside the City limits
and include a cancellation clause. Also that the charge for this service be higher than
those charged hotels in the City.

The City Manager was authorized to negotiate with Wilbur Clark to enter into this agree-
ment.

 The Advisory Board agreed with the Board of Commissioners that in planning for future
park playgrounds there should be several large parks instead of a number of small parks.

The Board requested advice from the Advisory Board on the acquisition of land for the
Cemetery. The Advisory Board agreed that land should be acquired in the very near fu-
ture and suggested obtaining land east of the present Cemetery.
