46

Since this strip never has been used and is not necessary, we feel the exchange of
this piece of land for a strip on Stewart to be used in widening Stewart Street
would benefit all who travel that street.

We wish also to call your attention to the hazard of the blind corner at 16th and
Stewart Street.

Your attention and consideration will be appreciated by all of us.

Respectfully yours,

/s/ C. L. Martin_________
