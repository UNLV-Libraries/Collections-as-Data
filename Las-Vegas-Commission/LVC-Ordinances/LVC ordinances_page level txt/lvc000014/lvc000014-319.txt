ORDINANCE NO. 347

AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 1602 (f) CHAPTER 16, OF THE BUILDING CODE OF THE CITY OF LAS
VEGAS ENTITLED: "AN ORDINANCE REGULATING THE ERECTION, CONSTRUCTION, ENLARGEMENT, ALTERATION,

REPAIR, MOVING, REMOVAL, CONVERSION, DEMOLITION, OCCUPANCY, EQUIPMENT, USE, HEIGHT, AREA AND
MAINTENANCE OF BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES IN THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS, NEVADA; PROVIDING FOR THE

PROVIDING PENALTIES FOR THE VIOLATION THEREOF, AND REPEALING ORDINANCES NUMBERS 130, 166, 188,
284, 285 AND ALL ORDINANCES AND PARTS OF ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH."

The Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas do ordain as follows:

Section 1. Section 1602 (f), Chapter 16, of the Building Code of the City of Las Vegas
as adopted by the above-entitled ordinance is hereby amended, revised and re-enacted to read
as follows:

Section 1602 (f) - Non-Conforming Occupancies. Any occupancy not permitted in Fire Zone #1
as covered by sub-section (e) of this section (1602), but existing at the time this ordinance
is enacted, shall be deemed, for the purpose and intent of this ordinance, a non-conforming
occupancy.

Such non-conforming occupancy shall be permitted to remain and be operated in Fire Zone #1
for a period up to August 22, 1950 only, provided that the maintenance and operation of such
occupancy is conducted in a manner minimizing hazard to life or property and satisfactory
to the Fire Chief of the City of Las Vegas.

After said period, and upon written notice of the Building Inspector, countersigned by the Fire
Chief, such non-conforming occupancy shall be made to comply with the requirements of Section
1008, Chapter 10 of this Code and the regulations and ordinances of the City of Las Vegas,
otherwise, the continued maintenance and operation thereof shall be forthwith discontinued.

At any time after such non-conforming occupancy is made to comply with the requirements of
Section 1008, Chapter 10 of this Code and the regulations and ordinances of the City of Las
Vegas, such non-conforming occupancy may be expanded or enlarged by any structural addition
or alteration, or by the erection of independent structures upon the same unit of land owner-
ship as such non-conforming occupancy is situate, provided, however, that such new construction
shall comply with the requirements of Section 1008, Chapter 10 of this Code and the regulations
and ordinances of the City of Las Vegas. In the event such non-conforming occupancy does
not comply with the requirements, aforesaid, at the time of an application for a building
permit for the new construction, said permit shall, thereupon, only be issued upon the con-
dition that such non-conforming occupancy shall be made to comply with said requirements
simultaneously with the progress of the work for such new construction.
