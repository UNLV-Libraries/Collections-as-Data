Section 1. For the purpose of defraying the cost of making certain improvements in the City of Las Ve-
gas by grading for and constructing oil bound gravel pavements and concrete curbs and gutters on all the streets
and portions of streets embraced within Special Assessment District #100-6, and more particularly described as
follows, to-wit:

The area from the south property line of Garces Street
to the north property line of Charleston Boulevard and
from the east property line of Main Street to the west
property line of 5th Street.

Said improvements to be made in accordance with the plats, diagrams and estimates of cost heretofore prepared and
adopted by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, and on file in the office of the City Clerk of
the City of Las Vegas, the Ex-Officio City Assessor of the City of Las Vegas is hereby empowered, authorized and
directed to make forthwith a special assessment in the total amount of Eighty-one Thousand, Nine Hundred Thirty-
nine Dollars and No Cents ($81,939.00), and to levy such assessment according to frontage against the owners and
upon the taxable lots and premises embraced within the special assessment district created by Ordinance #418 of
the City of Las Vegas.

Section 2. In no case shall the amount of any special assessment upon any such lot or premises exceed
50% of the value of such lot or premises as shown upon the latest tax list or assessment roll for State and County
taxation, but such cost in excess of 50% shall be borne by the City of Las Vegas and paid out of the General Fund.

Section 3. The Ex-Officio City Assessor of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, shall prepare an assessment
roll in the manner provided by the	Charter of the City	of	Las Vegas, Nevada, and shall assess each	lot or parcel

of land with such relative portion	of the whole amount	to	be levied in said district as the length	of	front	of such

premises abutting upon the improvement bears to the whole frontage of all the lots to be assessed; unless on ac-
count of the shape or size of any lot or lots an assessment for a different number of feet would be more equitable;
and the frontage of all lots to be assessed shall be deemed to be the aggregate number of feet as determined upon
for the assessment by the assessor.

Section 4. After the special assessment roll, as herein provided for, shall cause notice thereof to
the persons whose names appear upon the assessment roll, and to all others interested therein, to be published
for at least two weeks in some newspaper published in the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, of the time when the Board
of Commissioners and the Ex-Officio City Assessor will meet to review the assessment, and any person, objection
to the assessments, may file his objections thereto with the City Clerk.

Section 5. At the time appointed for reviewing the assessments, the Board of Commissioners and the
Ex-Officio City Assessor shall meet and give all persons interested an opportunity to be heard, and shall consider
any and all objections that may be	filed with the City	Clerk, and then, or at some adjourned meeting,	shall	re-
view the assessments and correct the same, and confirm	it	as corrected, or confirm it as reported,	or	annul	it,

and direct a new assessment to be made.

Section 6. When the assessments shall be confirmed as herein provided, it shall be final and conclu-
sive. The City Clerk shall thereupon deliver to the County Assessor, acting Ex-Officio City Assessor, the Assess-
ment Roll as confirmed by the Board of Commissioners, with his certificate of such confirmation, and of the date
thereof. The County Assessor, acting Ex-Officio City Assessor, shall thereupon, without extra compensation,
record such Assessment Roll in his office, and append thereto his certificate of the date of such recording,
whereupon from said date all persons shall be deemed to have notice of the contents of such Assessment Roll, and
it shall be prima facie evidence in all courts and tribunals of the regularity	of all	proceedings preliminary	to

the making thereof, and of	the validity of the assessment and Assessment Roll.	After	the Assessment Roll has	been

confirmed and recorded, the several amounts levied thereon shall become at once due and payable, and shall consti-
tute and be a lien upon the respective lots and parcels of land, and improvements assessed, and shall be charged
against the persons and properties until paid, provided that upon approval of any assessment, the amount there-
of may be divided into not	less than four nor more than ten installments, one of such	installments to be collected

each year, at such time as	the Board may determine, with an annual interest at	a rate	not exceeding 7%.

Section 7. All assessments, when due and payable, as in this ordinance provided, shall be paid to the
tax receiver of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, and by that officer paid into and credited to the special fund to
be known as and called "Las Vegas Street Improvement Assessment District No. 100-6 Fund".

Section 8. All costs and expenses incurred in making the improvements shall be charged to and paid out
of said fund, provided, however, that all monies drawn on the General Fund of the City of Las Vegas to defray any
of the costs and expenses of making the improvements, or, if it shall become necessary to draw upon the General
Fund to defray any of the costs and expenses of the improvements, except as otherwise provided by the Charter of
the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, the General Fund shall be reimbursed by transfer of funds from the "Las Vegas Street
Improvements Assessment District No. 100-6 Fund", as soon as conditions of the same will permit.

Section 9. This ordinance shall be and become effective immediately after its adoption, approval, and
the publication thereof for two consecutive weeks in the Las Vegas Review Journal, published in the City of Las
Vegas.

Section 10. The City Clerk of the City of Las Vegas is hereby authorized and directed to cause this
ordinance to be published in the Las Vegas Review Journal, a daily newspaper published in the City of Las Vegas
for a period of once a week for two consecutive weeks, immediately after its final passage and approval at this
