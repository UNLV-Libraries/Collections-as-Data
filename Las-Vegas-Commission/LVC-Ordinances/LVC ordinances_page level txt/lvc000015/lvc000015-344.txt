Ordinance No. 406, is hereby further amended to read as follows:

The pawnbroker shall retain in his possession every pledge or pawn ninety (90) days after the

provided further, that all personal property shall be held for redemption for a period of not less than

neglect for ninety (90) days after maturity of the loan, or ninety (90) days after the last payment of
interest, to redeem the pawned property, the pawnbroker may sell any such property held for redemption,
provided that such property shall have been held for redemption for a period of not less than one hundred
fifty (150) days from the date of pledge.

SECTION 2. Chapter 22, Section 13, of the Code of Las Vegas, Nevada, 1949 as amended by
Ordinance No. 406 is hereby further amended to read as follows:

Any pawnbroker or keeper of a pawnshop shall furnish to the pledgor a printed receipt clearly

interest when due, whichever period of time is the greater, you shall thereby forfeit all right and title
