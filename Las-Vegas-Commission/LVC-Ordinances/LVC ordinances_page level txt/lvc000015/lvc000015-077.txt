assessments shall be payable at the office of said Ex-officio City Treasurer in
ten substantially equal annual installments of principal, the first of which install-
ments of principal shall be due and payable on or before the 1st day of November,

1952, and the remainder of said installments shall be due and payable successively
on or before the same day in each year thereafter until paid in full, with interest
in all cases on the unpaid and deferred installments of principal from the 1st
day of November, 1951, at the same rate of interest as that provided for in the
special assessment bond to be hereafter authorized, sold, issued and delivered*
but not to exceed seven per centum (7%) per annum, payable annually at the office
of said Ex-officio City Treasurer, the first annual payment of interest being due
and payable on the said 1st day of November, 1952, and the remainder of said
annual installments of interest being due and payable on the 1st day of November

interest, when due, shall cause the whole of the unpaid principal to become due
and payable immediately, and the whole amount of the unpaid principal and accrued
interest shall thereafter draw interest at the rate of ten per centum per annum,
until the day of sale, but at any time prior to the day of the sale, the owner may
pay the amount of all unpaid installments, with interest thereon at ten per centum
per annum, and all penalties accrued, and shall thereupon be restored to the right
thereafter to pay in installments in the same manner as if default had not been
suffered, The owner of any property not in default as to any installment or payment
may, at any time, pay the whole of the unpaid principal with interest accruing thereon
to the nest interest paying date.
