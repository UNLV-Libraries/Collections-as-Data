Section 1. For the purpose of defraying the cost of making
certain improvements in the City of Las Vegas by installing complete
street lighting units with parkway cable and steel standards in,
over and along the easterly side of North Main Street from Stewart
Avenue to a point distand One Hundred Feet North of Bonanza Road,
according to the plats, diagrams and estimates of cost heretofore,
prepared and adopted by the Board of Commissioners of the City of
Las Vegas, and on file in the office of the City Clerk of the City
of Las Vegas, the Ex-Officio City Assessor of the City of Las Vegas
is hereby empowered, authorized and directed to make, forthwith, a
special assessment in the total amount of $1680.00	, and

to levy such assessment according to frontage against the owners
and upon the taxable lots and premises embraced within the special
assessment district created by Ordinance No. 328 of the City of Las
Vegas and composed of all the taxable lots and premises situate on
the easterly side of North Main Street from the North side of Stewart
Avenue to a point distant One Hundred Feet North of Bonanza Road.

Section 2. In no case shall the amount of any special
assessment upon any such lot or premises exceed 20% of the value
of such lot or premises as shown upon the latest tax list or
assessment roll for State and County taxation, but such cost in
excess of 20% shall be borne by the City of Las Vegas and paid out
of the General Fund.

assessment roll in the manner provided by the Charter of the City

within the aforementioned special assessment district such relative
portion of the whole amount to be levied as the length of front of
such lot or parcel of land abutting upon the improvement bears to
the whole frontage of all the lots to be assessed, unless on account
of the shape or size of any lot or lots, an assessment for different
number of feet would be more equitable, and the frontage of all lots
to be assessed shall be deemed to be the aggregate number of feet as
determined upon for assessment by the assessor.

and the Ex-Officio City Assessor will meet to review the assessments,
and any person objecting to the assessments may file his objection
thereto with the City Clerk.
