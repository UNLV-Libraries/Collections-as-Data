Honorable Mayor and
Board of City Commissioners

Las Vegas, Nevada

Re:	Streets and Highways

Gentlemen:

In accordance with a request through the City Manager's office,
consideration has been given to the nature and character of streets to be
improved adjoining the development of a complete city block bounded by
11th, 12th, Clark and Bonneville Streets.

In considering the problem with respect to several factors, it is
evident that a policy should be established that will be the basis of a
reasonable but definite development program for such improvements.

With respect to design and economics of the program then, it is
necessary to consider street widths, typical sections, paving areas and
appurtenanceS, of a standard or uniform nature; especially since a sub-
stantial portion of the street system will ultimately be involved.

The improvement will affect generally the development of streets
in the area bounded by Charleston boulevard, Tenth Street, Fremont Street
and Fifteenth Street. It is recommended that the streets lying within the
boundary streets above be improved by:

1.	Design

Typical standard paving width of 36", face to
face of curbs ("L" type curbs) for all streets
which are purely local, residential or neigh-
borhood streets and not major arterials,
excepting therefrom Maryland Parkway
which is to be developed in accordance
with constructed portions now installed
south of Charleston Boulevard.

These standards are absolutely functional
and efficient for the traffic to be accom-
modated at any time.

2.	Economics

The standards recommended are within reason with
regard to initial costs of installation
and future expense with respect to mainten-
ance. Such costs bear a direct relation to
valuations, tax structure and budgeting of
the city, therefore reflect on fiscal policy.
5

With present "bottlenecks" such as legal
limitations on improvement districts and the
increased cost of installing above-standard
improvements, it is evident that there is a
negative affect on desired improvements.

It is with deep concern that we request your earnest
consideration for adopting the policy recommended. If necessary,
we shall be happy to meet with you, at your request, to consider
or discuss further this important problem or to furnish further
descriptive or graphic details as you may desire.

Respectfully,

Las Vegas -- Clark County

Re:	STREETS & HIGHWAYS

Residential Streets

Gentlemen:

In accordance with our recommendation dated November
6, 1946, your tentative approval thereto and request for additional
detailed information, please be advised as follows.

The type of development and typical street section
has been carefully studied by the Joint Planning Commission.

This typical section has been delineated on a sketch attached
hereto and indicates the maximum paving width, location of
curbs and sidewalks. The placement of sidewalks was carefully
studied with relation to the parkway width between curb and
sidewalk and any additional right-of-way which would fall into
the front yard portion of abutting properties (such right-of-
way remainders not to be vacated). Placing the sidewalk as
indicated, sufficient parkway widths have been established to
permit the planting of shade trees without injury to curbs or
to pavement width, sidewalk area and front yard depth has been
retained. It is the concensus of opinion that if sidewalks
were moved closer to property line than indicated that the
parkway width would be increased to 13 or 14 feet and would not
receive proper maintenance or care from abutting property
owners as would this additional area if included in the front
yard between sidewalk and buildings.

This typical section is based on established standards
for traffic needs and is considered functional and adequate for
local residential streets as has been proven in many communities
where built.

Respectfully,

Re:	Zone Exception Case 24, Harry W. Garrett

1000 "E" Street, Lots 1 and 2, Block 2,

H. F. M. & N. Addition

Gentlemen:

It is respectfully recommended that you Honorable Board adopt and
order approving the recommendation of the Joint Planning Commission that the above	

petitioner be granted permission to use the lots indicated at the above address
for expansion of an existing use as outlined herewith. These lots are located
located in Residential Zone r, as legally described in the petition for exception,
a copy of which is on file in the Office of the Planning Commission.

It is further recommended that your order include the following provisions.

1.	The use petitioned for (Public garage) which use in-
cludes automobile repairing provided all operations	

are conducted wholly within a completely enclosed

building, but not including automobile body and fender
repairing or other operations that may be detrimental
to the general welfare of the residential neighborhood
adjacent thereto.

2.	That the building to be constructed be of building
code types 1, 2 or 3, to comply with other requirements
for Fire Zone 2 and the National Board of Fire Under-
writers requirements pert&ining to such occupancy.

3.	That any permits or licenses to operate such business
be issued under the same conditions as effects similar
businesses in other commercial districts in the City
of Las Vegas.

It is further recommended that in granting this zone exception, that
recognition can ultimately be made of similarly zoning the remaining three corners
7

At this intersection of "E" and Adams Streets. Such exception, however, will be granted
only on the basis that will permit establishment of trades or services which will serve
the local community as neighborhood business.

This petition involving property legally described therein and classified in
Residential Zone #4 was presented to and reviewed by the members of the Joint Planning
Commission on January 20, 1947.

After consideration of all factual data before the Commission, it was deter-
mined that the exception here recommended under the conditions set forth was consistent
with the intent and purpose of the City Zoning Ordinance.

At a meeting of the Joint Planning Commission held January 20, 1947, with

the Commission has taken the case under advisement and is studying every detail with
respect to the City land use and zoning plan. It was ordered that this matter and
the studies thereto be completed hurriedly and that Mrs. Nelms be rendered definite
decision within thirty days.

Re:	STREETS & HIGHWAYS

R/W Acquisition
Gibson & Jones Tract

Gentlemen:

The matter of acquiring right-of-way for street purposes adjoining the south
boundary of the Gibson & Jones Tract was considered at a meeting of the Joint Planning
Commission held January 20, 1947.

It is recommended that the acceptance of this right-of-way be approved in order
to establish a street to serve Lots 13 to 24, inclusive, Block 2 of the Gibson & Jones
Addition. At this time, if possible, it is recommended that sufficient acquisition be
made at the easterly portion of this dedicated strip to make possible a full connection
with 23rd Street. The establishment of this right-of-way will then become a portion of
Ogden Avenue as the same will ultimately be created by extension easterly from Bruce Street
or 18th Street.

Re

Re:	Zone Exception Case 25, Roy F. Thomas

105-107 W. St. Louis Street
Lots 15 and 16, Block 5

Gentlemen:

It is respectfully recommended that your Honorable Board adopt and order approving
the recommendation of the Joint Planning Commission that the above petitioner be granted
permission to use the lots indicated at the above address as a commercial lot. Such lots
are located at the above address in Residential Zone #5, as legally described in the
26

Petition for Exception, a copy of which is on file in the Office of the Planning Com-
mission.

It is further recommended that your order include the following provisions:

1.	That the building to be constructed on such lot be of Type 1, 2, or 3
construction, in order that it comply with the requirements for Fire
Zone #2.

2.	That said lots be subject only to such commercial use such as a trade,
service or retail establishment, and that the manufacture, processing
or handling of materials or articles usually conducted within an in-
dustrial zone not be permitted.

3.	That any permits or licenses to operate such business be issued under the

same conditions as effects similar businesses in other commercial district	

in the City of Las Vegas.

It is further recommended that in granting this zone exception, recognition can
ultimately be made of similarly zoning adjacent lots to the north and east, including
previous zone exceptions at this location that will permit establishment of a local
community or neighborhood commercial zone.

This petition involving property legally described therein and classified in
Residential Zone #5 was presented to and reviewed by the members of the Joint Planning
Commission on February 19, 1947.

 After consideration of all factual data before the Commission, It was determined
that the exception here recommended under the conditions set forth was consistent with
the intent and purpose of the City Zoning Ordinance.

Respectfully,

TO THE PLANNING BOARD OF THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS

We, the undersigned property owners in the vicinity of Stewart and 17th Street,
respectfully request the closing of the short strip of 17th Street through Block
22 of the 14th Street addition.
46

Since this strip never has been used and is not necessary, we feel the exchange of
this piece of land for a strip on Stewart to be used in widening Stewart Street
would benefit all who travel that street.

We wish also to call your attention to the hazard of the blind corner at 16th and
Stewart Street.

Your attention and consideration will be appreciated by all of us.

Respectfully yours,

It is respectfully recommended that your honorable body
adopt an order approving the recommendation of the Joint Plan-
ning Commission, that the above petitioner be granted permission
to use the rear portions of the above-mentioned lots for com-
mercial use. Such lots at present are partially located in
the Commercial and Residential Zone #1, as legally described
in the petition for exception, a copy of which is on file in
the office of the Planning Commission. This exception varies
the depth of the commercial zone at this location on the
easterly side of South Fifth Street at Wyoming Street, per-
mitting the owners to extend the construction and occupancy
of an Auto Court over the entire lots mentioned.

It is further recommended that your order include the
following conditions.

Conditions:

1.	That any buildings or structures constructed on the remainder
of such lots included in the Commercial Zone, be of type

1, 2 or 3 construction, in order that such structures
comply with the requirements of Fire Zone #2.

2.	That any permits or licenses to operate such business
be issued under the same conditions as affects similar
businesses in other commercial districts in the City
of Las Vegas.

This petition involving property legally described
therein and classified in Residence Zone #1, was presented
to and reviewed by the members of the Joint Planning Commission
on June 3, 1947.

After consideration of all factual data before the
Commission, it was determined that the exception here recom-
mended under the conditions set forth, was consistent with
the intent and purpose of the City Zoning Ordinance.

Respectfully,

LAS VEGAS---CLARK COUNTY

JOINT PLANNING COMMISSION

ordered spread on the Minutes:

The members of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas deeply
regret the passing of Claud C. Sargent. His untimely demise has deprived this city
of a sincere friend and a devoted public servant. Since making this his home in
1929, he established an enviable record for loyalty and integrity in the affairs
of business and municipal government. By his human qualities of kindness, toler-
ance and understanding, he found everlasting endearment in the hearts of those who
knew him, and earned an exalted place in life. His passing will be keenly felt by
us in municipal government who were benefitted by daily association with him, as
well as by the host of friends he left behind. We extend our deepest sympathy to
his family whose loss is irreparable. They may well take consolation in the know-
ledge that their husband and father was loved by all, and that no other can fill
the place he found in the hearts of his friends.

TYPICAL SECTION	Commissioner Whipple moved that the Board accept the recommendation

Addition	the Meadows and Boulder Addition as per the following letter:

	OFFICE OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION

August 6

19 4 7

Honorable Mayor and
Board of City Commissioners
City Hall
Las Vegas, Nevada

Re:	Streets and Highways

Meadows and Boulder Additions
Typical Street Section

Gentlemen:

In accordance with the request of the City Manager concerning the
above mentioned subject, please be advised that the Joint Planning
Commission has considered same at their regular meeting July 30,

1947, and makes the following recommendations in connection therewith.

The typical street section recommended for all rights of way eighty
(80) ft. in width is thirty-six (36) ft. of pavement, curb to curb, as
per our recommendation dated January 21, 1947. This section shall
apply to all local streets only, which eliminates such streets as South
Main and San Francisco which streets are designated in the major street
Plan for wider roadway sections. South Main Street is at present
being considered by the State Highway Department for widening.

Although San Francisco Street could be improved with this proposed
section, no definite plans exist nor does traffic volume warrant opening
to a greater width at this time.

The existing rights of way on East-West streets in the Meadows
Addition are fifty-(50) ft. in width. While it has been customary
to install pavement widths of twenty-four (24) ft. on fifty (50)
ft. of right of way as has been the case in some of the subdivisions	

designed by FHA, this Commission has always felt that such roadway is
neither efficient nor functional. Therefore, it is recommended that
a typical section of thirty-two (32) ft. in width, curb to curb, be
established for a fifty (50) ft. from the property line. A sketch
delineating this typical section is attached. This particular
recommendation is in accordance with that made in connection with
improvements of streets in the tentative subdivision (Scherer
Industrial Tract) adjacent to the West Boundary of the Meadows Addition.

It is called to your attention that the eighty (80) ft. right of
way in the Meadows Addition known as Fairfield Ave. is reduced to
fifty (50) ft. in width at the circular plaza in the center portion
of this tract. The thirty-six (36) ft. pavement on this section
should adjoin this central plaza since a curb section is already in-
stalled and which curb could be one of the roadway curbs. The location
of the roadway in this manner would leave approximately 12-14 ft. of parkway
on the outside of this right of way adjoining private property. In
addition to these recommendations, some thought should be given to the
elimination of the semi-circular plazas at the North and South ends
of Fairchild Avenue. This could be accomplished by adjustment of
rights of ways in these areas.

SWIM PROGRAM after	Commissioner	Whipple moved that the following swim	program	as re-

	MEMORANDUM

TO:	MAYOR & BOARD OF CITY COMMISSIONERS

SUBJECT:	SWIM PROGRAM AFTER SEPTEMBER 1st	AUGUST 15. 1947	

Pat Diskin, Swimming Pool Director, has submitted a memo
to the writer relative to the use of the City Pool for the Grade and
High School physical-ed program after school starts, September 1st.

Program is outlined as follows:

School Rate - 10¢ per person or $1.00 for 20 school days in
September.

1)	With one-hour periods commencing in the High School this
year, the coordinating of the school physical-ed program
with the city swimming pools, seems highly desirable;

2)	We understand that shower and toilet facilities for both
boys and girls at the High School will not be available until
late in the fall so it would seem that a swimming program for
part of this period would be desirable;

3)	Allowing 20 min. to go and return from the school, ten min.
to change; allowing a total of 30 min. for swimming in each
class;

4)	All classes will be supervised by qualified life-guards and
instruction for beginning swimmers will be given;

5)	It is hoped that our Grammar Schools of the city and the High
School as well, will take part in this program during the
month of September.

If the above program is agreeable to the Board, the writer will
so inform the School Superintendent so that plans can be made to
conduct the physical education classes at the city pool.

This seems a very desirable way to keep the pools in operation
after school starts, during the daytime giving the youngsters a
chance to swim at the reduced school rate. The children will already
have their swimming out of the way by 4:00 each afternoon; the pools
can ten be kept open until about 10:00 for adult swimming.

Your favorable consideration of this recommendation is urged.

Respectfully submitted,

It is further recommended that your order include the following
provisions:

1.	Any buildings or structures constructed on such lot be of

City of Las Vegas in order that the same comply with the occupancy and
structural requirements of Fire Zone No. 1

processing or handling of materials or articles usually conducted within
an industrial zone not be permitted.

3.	That any permits or licenses to operate such business be
issued under the same conditions as affects similar business in other
commercial districts in the City of Las Vegas.

This petition involving property legally described there in and
classified in Residential Zone #2 was presented to and reviewed by members
of the Joint Planning Commission on August 26, 1947. After consideration
of all factual data before members of the Commission, it was determined

Under date of August 12, 1947, the City Manager requested the

recommendation was reaffirmed by the Commission with order to advise
your Board accordingly.

"COOPERATION CONTRACT. This Contract entered into this 23rd day of	

September, 1947, by and between the Housing Authority of the City of	

Las Vegas, Nevada, (herein called the "City"), witnesseth:

1.	Whenever used in this Contract:	

(a)	The term "Project" shall mean the war housing developed by the	

Federal Government, now known as	PHA project No. NEV.-26021,	

and hereafter to be administered	as low rent housing within	

the City by the Authority.

(b)	The term "Taxing Bodies" shall mean the State and every political

for the acquisition by the Authority of the Project, and in that
event shall administer the Project as low-rent housing for families
of low income. The provisions of this contract shall be applicable
in respect to the Project in the event of such acquisition.

3.	The Project and the Authority being exempt from all taxes (and
special assessments) under the Constitution and Statutes of the State
of Nevada, the Authority shall make payments (herein called the
("PILOT") to the City in lieu of such taxes and special assessments
and in payment for municipal services and facilities furnished

for or with respect to the Project, as follows:

(a)	For the period from the day following the end of the tax	

year, the lien date of which was the last tax lien date
preceding the date of conveyance of the Project to the
Authority, to the close of the then current Project fiscal

year and for each of the next succeeding two Project fiscal
years and PILOT shall be in an amount equal to the greater
of either (1) all income of the Project, less (i) operating
expenses (including reserves, but excluding the PILOT) of	

the project, and less (ii) an amount computed at the rate	

of $17,476.00 per annum, or (2) ten per cent (10%) of
Shelter Rents earned during such period or fiscal year, as
the case may be;

(b)	For each succeeding Project fiscal year and continuing to a
date forty-five (45) years from the date of conveyance of the
Project to the Authority the PILOT shall be in an amount
equal to ten per cent (10%) of the Shelter Rents earned
during such fiscal year.

The PILOT made pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (b) above shall be

made after the end of each Project fiscal year, and shall in no event

exceed the lesser of (i) the amount of the real property taxes, which

would be paid on the Project if it were not exempt from taxation, or

(ii) all income of the Project after payment of operating expenses

(including reserves but excluding the PILOT) of the Project for the

period of fiscal year for which the PILOT is made. Upon failure of

the Authority to Make the PILOT, no lien against the Project or assets

of the Authority shall attach. The Authority covenants that it will

use its best endeavors consistent with the proper administration of

the Project for low-rent purposes to budget its expenditures and its

rental and other income in such manner that there will be available

in each year for PILOT, an amount at least equal to 10% of Shelter

Rents.	

The City shall distribute the PILOT among the Taxing Bodies in the	

proportion which the real property taxes otherwise payable to each
Taxing Body bear to the sum of the real property taxes of all Taxing
Bodies which would otherwise be levied against the Project; provided,
however, that no payment for any period or year, as the case may be,
shall be made to any Taxing Body including the City in excess of
the amount of the real property taxes which would have been paid to
such Taxing Body for such period or year, as the case may be, if the
Project were not exempt from taxation.

Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, no PILOT shall be
made for any period or year which would exceed the amount permitted
to be paid by the laws of the State for such period or year.

4.	During the period commencing with the date of the conveyance of the
Project to the Authority and continuing for forty-five (45) years
thereafter, the City without cost or charge to the Authority or the
tenants of the Project (other than the PILOT), with respect to the
"Project, shall (a) furnish to the Authority and the tenants of the Pro-
ject, the usual municipal services and facilities which are or may be
furnished without cost or charge to other dwellings and inhabitants in
the City, including but not limited to: educational, fire, police and
health protection and services, access street maintenance and repair,
snow removal, lighting on public streets on the boundaries thereof;	

(b) extend sanitary sewer mains to the site or sites of the Project and 

provide adequate sewer services for the Project; (c) waive any build-	

ing and inspection fees to which the Authority or the Project might
otherwise be or become subject; and (d) cooperate with the Authority

adjacent thereto as may be or become necessary in the administration
or further development or expansion of the Project, by accepting the
dedication of land for new streets and alleys or easements, by zoning

RESOLUTION No. 104	On motion of Commissioner Whipple, duly seconded by Commissioner Clark

RE: SEWER WAR PUBLIC carried unanimously the following resolution was adopted and order made:

WORKS PROJECT #Nev.

26-116-F	RESOLUTION #104

WHEREAS, the Government of the United States of America, during the recent war
time emergency, constructed, acquired and established Sewer War Public Works facilities
identified as Project No. Nev. 26-116-F and consisting generally of a disposal plant,
pipes, pipelines, accessories and facilities for the conveyance of sewage, together
with certain lands or interests in lands, in or near the City of Las Vegas, Clark County ,
Nevada, and

WHEREAS, the Government of the United States of America, by instrument in writing
dated July 1, 1946, leased the aforesaid Project to the City of Las Vegas, Nevada,
and by provision in said instrument granted to said City the option, during the original
term of said lease, or any renewal thereof, to purchase all of the Government's right,
title and interest in and to the leased property for the agreed and stipulated consideration
of the principal sum of Three Hundred twenty thousand Dollars ($320,000.00), less the
amount of all rental payments made under said lease, plus interest computed at the
rate of three per cent (3%) per annum on the principal sum or balances thereof, and

WHEREAS, the City of Las Vegas is now considering the acquisition of all of the
Government's right, title and interest in and to the aforesaid Project, by and through
its exercise of the option aforesaid, and

WHEREAS, a technical engineering investigation now discloses that the sewer works
of said Project have depreciated a far greater rate than that anticipated at the time
of the execution of the option agreement aforesaid and assumed as the basis for the
fixation of a fair valuation of said Project to be paid by the City of Las Vegas upon
the exercise of its option to purchase the same and

WHEREAS, in the light of the facts, revealed by said investigation, that deterioration
in said sewer works is progressing at a spiraling rate, resulting in an excessively
increased flow of infiltrated ground waters, necessitating the additional fixed cost of
treating the same, and that the utility life of said works is consequently considerably
shorter than that contemplated at the time of the execution of said option agreement,
obviously requiring an earlier retirement and replacement of said works, it now appears
that the valuation of said Project as reflected in the consideration expressed in the
option agreement for the purchase of said Project by the City of Las Vegas failed to
take into account circumstances subsequently developing and unforeseen at the time of
said agreement which would have materially effected a reduced and more accurate and
equitable valuation, and

WHEREAS, it was the intention of the parties at that time to express a consideration
which reflected a reasonably accurate, fair and equitable valuation of said Project, now,
therefore, be it

RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, in regular
session this 29th day of September, 1947, that it respectfully urge and request the
Government of the United States of America, through its duly constituted agencies,
to re-open and re-consider the question of the valuation for the Project aforesaid, and
join with the City of Las Vegas in an examination of all the facts and circumstances
now known or available having any bearing upOn a determination of a more accurate, fair
and equitable consideration to be paid by said City upon the exercise of its option
to purchase said Project.

KELSO TURNER	Pursuant to the joint meeting held with Brigadier General McDaniel,

	M. C. Redman of the Public Housing Administration, Army Personnel,

	Las Vegas Housing Board and the City Commissioners of the City of Las

Vegas, the Board of City Commissioners have met informally many times
and at regular meeting of the Board held on December 8th, went on
record as follows to substantiate their former request that the Kelso
Turner Housing in Las Vegas be turned over to them through their
Housing Board for administering.

1.	As early as October 1945 the City of Las Vegas, Nevada
became interested in the Disposal of the Kelso Turner
Housing and arran ed a meeting with Mr. John Berger of
the National Housing agency and followed the procedure
outlined by him and moved as rapidly as possible to
create a Housing Authority in Las Vegas and take over
the operation of the Housing in question.

2.	The Army did make a request for this housing before
the City made its formal request but the City was
moving as fast as possible to get itself in a position
to make a formal request to have this housing turned
over to them.

3.	If the City of Las Vegas can continue to operate this
Housing through its Housing Board - in a period of years
this housing will become the property of the City of
Las Vegas for low cost housing.

4.	If the Army would take over and operate this housing and
for any reason abandon its operations in Las Vegas or be
provided with permanent housing - this housing would be
disposed of and could be disposed of in such a manner

that would be detrimental to the best interests of the City.

5.	If the City of Las Vegas can operate this housing it will
receive funds from the Government in lieu of taxes amounting
to approximately $5,000.00 per year (see letter from Housing
Board) and will be paid for other services performed, and
the State, County and Schools will also benefit from funds
paid in lieu of taxes. The City of Las Vegas has expanded so
fast and is continuing to expand so fast, the City must

look to every source of revenue if we are to progress and
maintain good sanitation, fire protection and law enforcement.

6.	The City of Las Vegas in turning over to the Army, the Las
Vegas Army Airfield will lose rental income exceeding $10,000.00
per year and will turn buildings and land over to the Army

in excess of $15,000.00.

7.	This housing being situate within the City limits of Las

Vegas, the City can better serve the Army personnel living	

therein by using the services now maintained by the City.

8.	The Housing Board set up to operate this housing is an
appointive Board subject to the will of the City Commission
and the City can and will guarantee that any Board operating
this housing will give all available housing in this project
to Army personnel.

9.	Approximately 50 units are now being occupied by persons	

other than Army, Navy, Veterans and Army Field employees

and the City will take the necessary steps to evict the
tenants and make this housing available for the Army.

PUBLIC BUILDINGS &	The following recommendation from the Joint Planning Commission

GROUND - Westside	was presented to the Board for their consideration:

Recreation Center

"This commission is in receipt of a request from the Superintendent
	of the Las Vegas Union School District, Mr. Walter D. Johnson, with

regard to use of the open area lying between the West Side Swimming
Pool and the West Side Elementary School.

It is the desire of the School Board that some joint arrangement be
established between the City and the School District whereby the entire
open area could be developed for playground and recreational purposes.

While this has been the thought of the City for some time, there should
be certain commitments with regard to the development, including the
closing of Adams Street between C and D Streets, which would not only
eliminate the possibility of accidents to children but permit the use
of approximately an additional one-half acre of area.

This request and anticipated use was considered at a regular meeting	

of the Joint Planning Commission held November 25, 1947, with the
recommendation that such use be established, together with the closing
of Adams Street. The closing of Adams Street can be accomplished either
through vacation or merely barricades. In the event any structures
are to be erected now or in the future, vacation would then be desirable,
in which case the necessary legal procedure must be established. In
any event, if structures are not to be erected in the area which would
normally be used for street purposes, then game and play areas could
be established.	—

With concurrency by Your Board and sanction of the above, this area
may be put to beneficial use for students at the school and inhabitants
of the West Side in general."

Thereafter, Commissioner Baskin moved that the recommendation of the
Planning Board be approved relative to Westside Recreation Center
subject to the approval of the City Manager. Motion seconded by Com-
missioner Whipple and carried by the following vote* Commissioners Baskin
Clark, Whipple and His Honor voting aye. Noes, none. Absent:	Com-

missioner Moore.

	your Honorable Board relative to the above-mentioned subject. In
173

connection with this vacation, the Commission further recommend that
the petition comply with certain conditions before said vacation was
completed.

In accordance with Item A of said conditions, we have received a
proposed re-subdivision of Block 22, 14th Street Addition, a copy of
which is attached. At a regular meeting of the Joint Planning Commission
held November 25, 1947, this proposed re-subdivision was approved,
with the recommendation that your Board concur in this action.

When this matter has received your approval, the petitioner may proceed
to have a final map made for recording purposes." **

Thereafter, Commissioner Clark moved that the matter be referred to
the City Manager. Motion seconded by Commissioner Baskin and carried

ever increasing population and particularly by the War Department re-
activation of the Las Vegas Army Air Field which will bring several
thousand Army personnel with their families into the City of Las Vegas
seeking home accommodations, and

WHEREAS, the building industry in the City of Las Vegas is making a
prodigious effort to provide the necessary housing to meet the present
and ever increasing demand therefor, and

WHEREAS, the successful and timely prosecution of the aforesaid building
program depends in large measure upon the expeditious consideration by
the Federal Housing Administration of formal applications for building
loans, and

Administration field offices, the needs of the entire State of Nevada
are administered only by a branch office in the City of Reno which is
subsidiary to the main office in San Francisco, California, and

projects in the State of Nevada must first be filed with said branch
Office at the City of Reno for preliminary consideration and then forwarded
by said office to the main area office in San Francisco, California, for
further and final consideration and disposition, thereby entailing an ex-
panded period of time before such loans may be consumated and necessarily
resulting in the delay of essential construction, now, therefore, be it

RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas at a
recessed regular meeting thereof held on the 8th day of December, 1947,
that it respectfully urge upon the Federal Housing Administration the
imperative need of the City of Las Vegas for the expeditious determination

and disposed of with finality, and be it further

forward a copy of this resolution to the federal Housing Administration in

and

WHEREAS, the Indians on the Navajo Reservations have for some time past
and are at present in destitute condition and suffering acutely for want

hand from such tax levy or levies, insufficient funds to pay the
same, shall be promptly paid when due from general funds on hand
belonging to the City of Las Vegas, reimbursement to be made to
such general funds in the sums thus advanced when taxes herein
provided for shall have been collected.

fied and discharged.

	OFFICE OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION

January 30

Honorable Mayor and
Board of City Commissioners
War Memorial Building
Las Vegas, Nevada

Re:	STREETS AND HIGHWAYS

Vacation

South Second Street
Wyoming Street

Gentlemen:

This will reply to your request for recommendation in connection
with the attached petition, relative to the above-mentioned sub-
ject.

At a regular meeting of the Joint Planning Commission held January
27th, 1948, this petition was considered, and upon motion duly made
and unanimously carried, it was recommended that the vacation be
approved, which involves -

The easterly seven and one-half feet (E.7 1/2') of
Second Street immediately adjacent to and westerly of
Lots 1,2,3,4 and 5, and the Southerly seven and one-
half feet (S.7 1/2') of Wyoming Street immediately
adjacent to and Northerly of Lot 1, all of said Lots
being in Block 18, Boulder Addition to the City of
Las Vegas, as shown by a Map thereof on file in Book
1 of Plats, Page 52, in the Office of the County
Recorder, Clark County, Nevada.

The Commission is concerned, however, with the establishment of a
precedent in this instance, which may pave the way for similar
actions in the future. It is obvious that it may not be possible,
in every case, to grant such vacations without detriment to the
Street system, especially in such instances where future widening
of roadway is essential or necessary.

In this respect, it may be wise to have a further opinion of the City
Attorney with regard to such precedent - that is, the relationship
between the present opinion, in which case the City is absolved of liab-
ility by reason of an encroachment, and the necessity of retaining
sufficient right of way for future need. The question remains -
could the City again, at some time in the future, acquire such portions
vacated without becoming involved - or could a proper and legal side
agreement be arranged between the City and parties involved, stip-
ulating that said right of way or portion thereof now being vacated
by reason of encroachment, be re-conveyed to the City at such time
as the encroachment may be removed or otherwise cleared.

Re:	STREETS AND HIGHWAYS

Vacation

South Ninth Street

Gentlemen:

This Commission has considered the request of the School Board to
establish a proper alignment on South Ninth Street between Lewis and
Clark Streets. This realignment, due to a discrepancy in the subdivision
boundaries of the Wardie and Pioneer Heights Additions, can be accomplished
by vacating a uniform strip of ten feet (10') in width on the Westerly
side of said Ninth Street, and acquiring in lieu thereof, the dedication
of a uniform strip of land ten feet (10') in width on the Easterly side
thereof, as delineated on the attached map.

The Joint Planning Commission, in considering this matter at a regular
meeting held January 27, 1948, and on motion duly made and unanimously
carried, recommends this procedure be approved, provided the necessary
petition is submitted to your Board, together with the offer of dedication
to secure the action.

Re:	LAND USE

Zone Exceptions
Administrative Procedure

Gentlemen:

This is to advise you concerning your recent request that the Plan-
ning Commission consider the possibility of stream-lining the pro-
cedure in connection with the processing of applications for zone
exceptions.

At a regular meeting of the Planning Commission held January 27,

1948, it was established by chair order that any application for zone
exception be approved with waiver of all signature requirements of
surrounding property owners (present policy and procedure), provided
said application involves a use as established in the recommended
land use plan now being considered for adoption, and all regulations
stipulated therein. If agreeable with your Board, such applications
would be approved in the Office of the Planning Commission, and any
subsequent permits of the Building Department issued under such
conditional approval without first having to be submitted to your
Board, unless your Honorable Board deems it necessary that all such
applications first be approved by your action.

If this procedure is approved, the same will be set in effect immed-
iately.

Respectfully yours,

s/ C. G. Petrie

Honorable Mayor and

Las Vegas, Nevada

Re:	STREETS AND HIGHWAYS

Alleys - Aerial Use of

Gentlemen:

On December 16, 1947, Mr. P. 0. Silvagni, proprietor of the Apache
Hotel, appeared before this Commission concerning the possible use
207

of the area over and above a public alley. Mr. Silvagni owns property
on both sides of and abutting the alley at the easterly portion of Block
15, Clark's Las Vegas Townsite.

On the above-mentioned date the Commission took this matter under advise-
ment and ordered a study made with regard to the possibility of permitting
such use.

On January 27, 1948, the Planning Commission, upon report of the City
Engineer, discussed and considered the various aspects of this problem
and, Upon motion duly made and unanimously carried, recommends the
following as the basis of permitting structural development over alley-
ways, provided such procedure is first approved by the City Attorney
as to compliance with any laws relative to permitting or prohibiting
such use:

1.	Lease-Rental Arrangement to be determined upon square foot
basis for area covered, such charge being established in
relation to appraised value of abutting property.

2.	Legal Clearance required to be maintained above paved surface
of alley.

3.	Utilities and Public Facilities within, over, and above said
alley to be properly rearranged with the approval of the
utilities or operating agency concerned, and/or the City of
Las Vegas.

4.	Structural Development over and above alley area to be approved
by the City of Las Vegas through the Building Department or
other departments as deemed necessary.

This recommendation is forwarded to your Honorable Board as a basis for
such permits only, and is not to be construed as a recommendation that
any such permits to be issued until the proper legal counsel has been
secured and the plan established as a matter of policy by the Board of
City Commissioners. It is possible that any permits, if granted for
such use, be on the basis of a separate ordinance for each and every
case.

Respectfully yours,

LAS VEGAS -- CLARK COUNTY
JOINT PLANNING COMMISSION
s/ C. G. Petrie

Thereafter Commissioner Clark moved that the matter be referred to the

STREETS & HIGHWAYS The following inter-office communication from the City Engineer
Charleston Blvd. Under- relative to Charleston Blvd., underpass at the Union Pacific Rail-
pass at Union Pacific road was presented to the Board for their consideration:

Railroad

	"In accordance with a meeting held in this office April 1, 1948,

	with Mr. 0. W. Wright, Division Engineer, and other representatives

of the State Highway Department, the following items relative to
design and R/W acquisition were agreed upon:

1.	SOUTH FIRST STREET

In order that a better intersection design be obtained
at Main Street and Charleston Boulevard, it is proposed
that South First Street between Charleston Boulevard
and Boulder Street be vacated and closed, eliminating
this portion of the present intersection.

Under date of August 31, 1943, the Joint Planning
Commission recommended certain adjustment of local
streets in connection with the Tonopah-Charleston
highway improvement, item 2 of said recommendations
stipulating the closing and vacating of this portion
of First Street. This recommendation was subsequently
approved by the Board of City Commissioners under date
of September 2, 1943.

2.	SOUTH MAIN STREET

It appears that the most satisfactory solution to
obtaining r/w at the northwest corner of Main Street
and Charleston Boulevard (Klein Property) will be
subject to the manner in which the small remainder of
Main Street, lying west of this intersection, is developed.

It is proposed that a 30 ft. (30') roadway be constructed
on this eighty ft. (80') r/w, permitting twenty five ft.

(25') parking strips fronting each of the abutting
properties (Klein and Southern Nevada Industries). This
30' roadway would not intersect with Charleston Boulevard,
but would turn westerly north of the Charleston Boulevard
roadway and serve as an access road to properties north of
the underpass. This roadway should be physically separated
from the Charleston roadway by curbing and other adequate
barriers.

C. G. Petrie, City Engineer".

Thereafter, Commissioner Moore moved that the proposal of the City
Engineer as heretofore outlined relative to R/W acquisition be approved
and the City Manager be directed to make a survey as to the cost of
the proposed acquisition. Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple
and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners Baskin, Moore, Whipple

and His honor voting aye. Noes, none. Absent:	Commissioner Clark.


STREETS & HIGHWAYS	At this time a petition signed by four (4) freeholders requesting

Petition for Vacation	that the Board of City Commissioners vacate 8th Street from Bridger

of South 8th Street	to Clark Street and the alley between 9th and 10th Streets from

between Bridger & Clark Lewis to Clark Street was presented to the Board for their consideration.
Streets 	Thereafter, Commissioner Moore moved that the petition be referred to

	the Planning Commission for immediate recommendation. Motion seconded by

Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners Baskin

Moore, Whipple and His Honor voting aye. Noes, none. Absent:	Com-

missioner Clark.

APPLICATION FOR REFUND Commissioner Moore moved that pursuant to an opinion of the City
OF LICENSE	FEES	Attorney,	the	request of Lawrence R. Palmer of Topper's Kitchen

	419 South	5th	Street and Bud E. Bodell, The Rib Bar-B-Q, 407 Fremont

	Street for refunds of licenses issued by the City Clerk be denied

on the ground that the Board of City Commissioners have no authority
to make refunds. Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried
by the following vote:	Commissioners Baskin, Moore, Whipple and His

Honor voting aye. Noes, none. Absent:	Commissioner Clark.

STREETS & HIGHWAYS	At this time the recommendation of the Planning Commission was received

8th	Street	vacation	approving	the	vacation of 8th Street between Bridger and Clark Streets,

	and the alley	between 9th & 10th Street from Lewis to Clark, thereafter,

Commission be approved and the City Clerk authorized to post notices
of a public hearing on said proposed vacation of South 8th Street between
Bridger and Clark Streets, and the alley between 9th & 10th Streets
from Lewis to Clark, and to set the date of said hearing for Wednesday
May 21st, 1948 at the hour of 2:00 P.M. Motion seconded by Commissioner
Whipple and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners Baskin,

Moore, Whipple and His Honor voting aye. Noes, none. Absent:	Com-

Lot 11, Block 18, H.F.M.&M. Addition

Gentlemen:

It is respectfully recommended that your Honorable Board adopt an order
approving the recommendation of the Joint Planning Commission that the
above petitioner be granted permission to use the lot indicated above
as requested, such property being located in Residential Zone #4, on
the south side of Jefferson Street, between "F" and "G" Streets, as
legally described in the petition for exception, a copy of which is on
file in the Office of the Planning Commission. The approval of the use
requested is to permit the use of an existing building on said premises
for radio repairing, with no enlargement of said quarters for such use
and that such use be interpreted as a home occupation defined as follows:

HOME OCCUPATION

An occupation carried on by the occupant of a dwelling as an
incidental or a secondary use, in connection with which there
is no change in the character of the dwelling and there is no
display, no stock in trade nor commodity sold on the premises,
no assistants employed, and no mechanical equipment used except
such as is necessary for purely domestic purposes. Clinics,
surgeries, hospitals, barber shops, beauty parlors, business
offices, and professional offices shall not be deemed home oc-
cupations.

This approval specifically does not include an approval for general com-
mercial use of said premises.

This petition, involving property legally described therein and classified
in Residential Zone #4, was presented to and reviewed by the members of the
Joint Planning Commission on April 27, 1948.

After consideration of all factual data before the Commission, it was
determined that the exception here recommended under the conditions set
forth was consistent with the intent and purposes of the City Zoning
Ordinance.

Respectfully yours,

Honorable mayor and board of City Commissioners
War Memorial Building
Las Vegas, Nevada

Re:	SUBDIVISIONS

Monte Vista Village, Tentative Map

Gentlemen:

This is to advise you concerning the above-mentioned subject.

On May 21, 1948, at a special meeting, this Commission considered a tentative map
and certain other phases in connection with the development of this proposed subdivision.
The results of this meeting, which was held concurrently with a meeting of your Board,
were discussed before you, prior to the transmittal of written recommendations.
Subsequently, your Board made a commitment to approve this tentative map on the basis
of said recommendations, pending receipt of written report thereon.

The Planning Commission is now in receipt of a letter from Horace Shidler & Son, Inc.,
stating that they have been unable to consummate the transfer of property to effect
the development, and therefore the same has been abandoned.

This is for your information relative to your previous action in this respect.

Respectfully yours,

LAS VEGAS-CLARK COUNTY JOINT PLANNING COMM.

Proposal	Sewer Disposal Plant Bond Issue be accepted subject to the attached

stipulations:

	June 30, 1948

Honorable Mayor and City Commission
Las Vegas, Nevada

Gentlemen:

WHEREAS, you have heretofore voted $350,000 Sewer Disposal Plant
Bonds to mature over twenty years and to carry interest and not to ex-
ceed 3%, and when said bonds were offered at public sale no bids were
received and your efforts since that time to secure and offer at par
for the bonds, have been fruitless, and

WHEREAS, you have had under consideration an ordinance providing
for monthly sewer service charges to be levied against property owners
receiving service, and the tentative schedule now drawn up by you is
estimated to bring approximately $90,000 per year, and

WHEREAS, I believe that in cooperation with my bond attorneys I
can work out a legal method whereby said service charges can be pledged
to the retirement of principal and interest on the referred to bond
issue, and thus be used to supplement if necessary the taxes levied
and available for the purpose of bond servicing, and I believe I can,
under the direction of my bond attorneys, provide to you such procedures
and mechanisms as will insure collections of the monthly service charges,
and will set up proper trust funds for the monies so collected together
with legal and sound safe guards so that disbursements may be properly
and economically made, and so that the above referred to bond issue may
be supported with the provisions and security which are normally had
by revenue bonds, and therefore bring about the result that you can
market the 3% bonds at par,

NOW THEREFORE, I PROPOSE to have prepared and submitted to you an
ordinance providing for the monthly service charges designated by you
and for the handling and collection of the monies and their proper dis-
bursement, and for pledging said monthly service charges to the repay-
ment of the bonds and interest thereon, and to submit to you the neces-
sary procedures as outlined above, all of which will be prepared and dir-
ected by my bond attorneys and submitted for the approval of your City
Attorney and your City Commission, I agree also, to supply the bond forms,
lithographed and prepared for your signature.

Immediately upon approval of my bond attorney for your legal right,
so to proceed both under your City Charter and under the laws of the
State of Nevada, and upon your subsequent approval of the ordinance and
procedure -- with such changes and amendments as you and your city attorney
desire and to which my bond attorneys will agree, I will have presented
to you a bid of par	or better, for your referred	to $350,000	bond issue,

maturing as heretofore provided by you over	a 20	year period	and carrying

interest at 3% and I will qualify said bid by attaching thereto a certi-
fied check as required by law. The last ten maturities of the bond is-
sue will contain an	option of retirement on	your	part on any	annual in-
terest date and the	remainder optional five	years from their	issuance

and on any interest date thereafter.

For these services, you are to pay me Five Dollars per One Hundred
262

Dollars on the bonds issued, said amount to be paid simultane-
ously with the sale and delivery of the bond issue. If such a
bid is not made by me promptly as above set forth, or if my bond
attorney will not approve the revenue bond feature as above out-
lined then there shall be no obligation to you under this agreement.

This proposal respectfully submitted this 30th day of June,

1948.

DRY CLEANERS PETITION Mayor Cragin read the following opinion of the City Attorney regarding
Re: Opinion of City the petition of the dry Cleaning establishments of the City, dated
Attorney	June 29, 1948 and on file in the office of the City clerk.

July 13, 1948

TO:	HONORABLE MAYOR E. W. CRAGIN and the

BOARD OF CITY COMMISSIONERS

SUBJECT:	LAS VEGAS DRY CLEANERS ASSOCIATION LETTER OF

JUNE 28, 1948, ADDRESSED TO YOU AND REFERRED
TO THIS OFFICE.

In reply to the letter of the members of the Las Vegas Dry
Cleaners Association dated June 28, 1948, addressed to you,
and referred to this office, relative to passing legislation
giving them equal protection with concerns of a like nature
operating from foreign communities, please be advised that
I have checked the constitutionality of a city requiring
a larger license fee from a concern operating from a foreign
community than is charged to a local concern.

A check of the City Clerk's office indicates that in many in-
stances local cleaning establishments are actually paying a
higher fee than is required of a similar business concern
whose principle place of business is located outside our City Limits.

After an examination of the law in regard to this question,

I find that there is an indication that permanent or estab-
lished places of business within cities have been the bene-
factors of favored positions in many city ordinances. While
the decisions are conflicting, and in some cases even con-
fusing, the numerical majority of the courts have held that
such preferential treatment of local business constitutes
a denial of equal protection, or abridges the privileges and
amenities clause of the Federal Constitution.

I feel that there is no question but what the City can impose
as stringent conditions upon businesses operating from foreign
communities as are imposed upon those which are located within
the City Limits.

The ordinance could be amended requiring a business operating
from a foreign community to pay a license fee based upon the
gross business the same as is Imposed upon our own merchants.

There are many cities, as I have indicated hereinabove, that
have passed ordinances imposing a higher license fee on out-
of-town merchants and dealers than are imposed upon their own
residents. It might well be that our state would follow the
minority opinion and thus sustain such a position unless the
fee was so high that it would be considered absolutely prohi-
bitive upon the face of it.

One of our sister cities within the County does impose a license
fee of $300.00 on businesses from foreign communities, and, there-
fore, it occurs to me that it would be equitable for your Honorable
Board to amend our ordinance governing this situation by imposing a
reasonable fee (collectible quarterly, or annually) as the Board might
decide, in addition to a fee based upon the gross business done by
the respective businesses.

If the foreign business were only assessed the same fee as the
local business it would still be inequitable because of the fact
that the business operating from a foreign community would not be
subject to the taxes and other costs of operation imposed upon the
local business.

Respectfully submitted,

C. Norman Cornwall /s
C. Norman Cornwall
City Attorney

Thereafter the foregoing opinion was Ordered filed.

DOMINO GAME	Mayor Cragin read the letter of	Mr. Frank Gordon, Idle Hour, 17-19 Ogden,

Letter from	dated July 16, 1948, concerning	the installation of a domino game in con-

Frank Gordon	junction with his billiard parlor. The City Attorney stated that it was

his opinion that it would be necessary for Mr. Gordon to make a gaming
	application. Thereafter the City Clerk was instructed to inform Mr. Gordon

of this matter.

NUISANCE PETITION	Commissioner Whipple moved that	a hearing be set for August 6, 1948 at

Re: Bush Brothers	2:00 P.M for the Bush Brothers	Trucklines to appear before the Board

Trucklines	to answer a complaint of an alleged nuisance submitted to the Board


267

in form of a Petition, and that the City Clerk be instructed to

send notice of said date and time of hearing to the interested parties.

Commissioners Clark, Moore, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.
Absent; Commissioner Baskin.

U-DRIVE APPLICATION	Commissioner Moore moved that the application of C. F. Shaw for a U-Drive

C. F. Shaw	be approved and license issued when the proper insurance policy has been

filed in the office of the City Clerk.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Clark, Moore, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

CITY ATTORNEY OPINION At this time Mayor Cragin read the following opinion to the Board.

Re:	L.W. Gibbs Proposal

$350,000 Sewage disposal
Bond Issue

August 6, 1948

Honorable Mayor E. Cragin
and Board of Commissioners of
the City of Las Vegas,

Las Vegas, Nevada

In re:	PROPOSAL OF LAWREN W. GIBBS DATED JUNE 30, 1948 COVERING

THE $350,000.00 SEWER DISPOSAL PLANT BOND ISSUE AND
THE CITY'S CONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE
275

Gentlemen:

After studying the proposal of Mr. Lawren W. Gibbs in connection with
his offer to purchase the $350,000.00 Sewer Disposal Plant Bonds upon
being paid $5.00 per $100.00 on the Bonds Issued for his services in
connection therewith, and the City's conditional acceptance conditioned
upon the approval of all proceedings, resolutions and ordinance in
connection therewith by the City Attorney of the City of Las Vegas, it
is my opinion that such a procedure would be unconstitutional and void.

Senate Bill No. 84 of the 1947 Session of the Legislature amending the
Charter of the City of Las Vegas as found on Page 320 of the 1947 Statutes
of Nevada, referring to "Sewage Bonds" provides, "Said bonds shall be sold
at not less than their par value and shall be redeemable in the order
of their Issuance within twenty-five years of their date of issue .............."

In addition thereto, Section 6087 N.C.L. 1929 provides in part that any
bonds issued by a municipal corporation shall be sold at not less than
par and accrued interest, nor at any discount or commission be allowed
or paid on the sale of such bonds.

It is my opinion that an agreement wherein the City of Las Vegas would
agree to pay a commission of $5.00 per $100.00 of the bonds sold would
constitute a sale at a discount and be unlawful.

It is my opinion that the City of Las Vegas through its Board of Commissioners
does not have the authority to enter into an agreement for the sale of said
bonds at a discount, and, therefore, the proposal, resolution and conditional
acceptance is not approved by your City Attorney, because such acceptance
is contrary to the law.

Respectfully submitted,

C. Norman Cornwall /s

Cornwall dated August it, 1948 be included in these minutes:

August 4, 1948

Honorable Mayor E. W. Cragin
and Board of City Commissioners,

Las Vegas, Nevada

In re:	PROPOSED AMENDMENT OF SUBDIVISION NO. 77OF SECTION 2 OF ORDINANCE NO.

349 OF THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS

Gentlemen:

Pursuant to your request for an opinion as to the constitutionality of the
proposed amendment of Subdivision No. 77 of Section 2 of Ordinance No. 349
of the City of Las Vegas, which was prepared and submitted to your Honorable
Board for passage by the law firm of Morse and Graves, I have researched the
legal problems involved therein and submit the following.

The problems involved in this proposed ordinance are:

(1)	Whether the legislative body (the Board of Commissioners

of the City of Las Vegas) has the authority and power under
its Charter to regulate businesses of all kinds, and

(2)	To what extent the said legislature can regulate the parti-
cular type of business covered in said proposed ordinance, and
278

(3)	Particularly that portion of said proposed ordinance which requires
every person licensed under the proposed subdivision to furnish and
distribute to any applicant, "without discrimination as to character
of service furnished and fee charged therefor," information custom-
arily and regularly furnished by licensee thereunder to the operators
of race horse books in the City of Las Vegas duly licensed under the
provisions of said Ordinance No. 325.

There is no question that the City of Las Vegas, through its Board of City Commissioners
has the authority and power under its Charter to regulate and license businesses of all
kinds, but in the exercise of such power there are certain fundamental rights which the
City, or even the State itself, cannot take away.

In the absence of authority granted by the legislature, a municipal corporation has no
right to fix the price of commodities sold at retail (see 43 C.J. 413, Section 544).

The State Legislature of the State of Nevada gave to the City of Las Vegas, Nevada,
through its Charter the power to regulate and license businesses of all kind. The
extent to which the Board of Commissioners can go depends upon the type and kind of
business which it is endeavoring to regulate.

In the operation of an ordinary business, a person has the right to fix the price
at which he wishes to sell his commodity, and he has the right to refuse to sell at
any price and the right to select his customers, and to sell to some and refuse to
sell to others; to sell to some at one price and on one set of terms and to sell to
others at a different price and on a different set of terms (see Union Pacific Coal
Co. vs. U.S., 173 Fed. 737). This is true only, however, when the business is not
"affected by the public interest."

In Ex Parte Kazas (90 Pac. (2d) 962) the court said, "the police powers extend to
legislation promoting the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the
people." Continuing with its opinion the court, referring to the case of PEOPLE
vs. NEBBIA (a New York case regulating the milk business) "police power is the
least limitable of the powers of government and extends to all the great public
needs. Statutes aiming to establish a standard of social justice, to conform law
to the accepted standards of the community, to stimulate the production of a vital
food product by fixing living standards of prices for the producer, are to be inter-
preted with that degree of liberality which is essential to the attainment of the
end in view.

Courts should be clearly convinced that the legislation under consideration is
unconstitutional before declaring it invalid; and all presumptions are in favor
of the constitutionality of the legislative enactment."

In a California case wherein the legislative body had passed a statute regulating
the lemon industry and regulating prices to be charged, the amount to be produced,
etc., the court stated, "We do not feel that we are in any way or to any extent
extending the principles of law enunciated in the authorities cited above by hold-
ing such a business is so affected with the public interest or clothed with a public
use as to justify the state in its exercise of its police power to impose such
reasonable regulations upon the quantity that may be produced and marketed therein
as will save the industry from destruction and from ruthless competition, the direct
effect of overproduction.

'Where business is affected with a public interest or clothed with a public use,*
it may be regulated under the general welfare division of the police power. Al-
though the phrase 'affected with a public interest' has never been exactly defined,
a study of the cases reveal that, running through all of the cases, one constant
principle, namely, that the regulated trade must affect the property of a large
body of the members politic. Such legislation to be justified and supported must
at least promote the welfare of the general public as contrasted with that of a
small percentage or insignificant numerical proportion of the citizenry."

There is no question in my mind but that the business proposed to be regulated by
the above proposed ordinance is "intrastate", and not "interstate", nor is it a
public utility.

There is no question but that the "information", the distribution of which is lic-
ensed by the said proposed ordinance, is a commodity which ceases its interstate
phase and becomes intrastate when distributed by the owner thereof to the various
purchasers, and the City of Las Vegas through its Board of Commissioners has a
right to charge a license fee therefor. If the business is one which is "affected
with a public interest," the regulation can be much greater than if it is not.

It is to be noted that every statute or ordinance which attempts to regulate a
lawful business inserts therein the reason for the particular regulation and the
evil which the regulation intends to overcome. In the case of NELSEN vs TILLY
(Neb. 1939) (269 N.W. 388; 126 A.L.R. 729), construing a statute in a declaratory
judgment proceedings covering the regulation of motor vehicles the court said,

"the legislature under its police power, has the right to regulate the purchase
and sale of motor vehicles for the protection and general welfare of the public."
279

The division (i), (j) and (k) of the law provided that the administrator of the law
might deny or revoke a license on proof that the applicant or licensee is (i) wil-
fully discriminatory, directly or indirectly, in price differences where it will
substantially lessen competition and thereby tend to create a monopoly or tend to
injure or destroy the business of the competitor, (j) willful discrimination be-
tween purchasers, or (k) willful discrimination in regard to trade-ins so as to
destroy a competitors business or tend to create a monopoly.

The Court pointed out that the constitutional guarantees contemplate that every
person legally possesses the right of acquiring the absolute and unqualified
title to every species of property recognized by law, with all rights incidental
thereto, and, in connection with the right to dispose of such property in such
innocent manner as he pleases, and to sell it at such price as he can obtain in
fair barter (28l N.W. 607). A person has a right to follow any lawful business
pursuit, not injurious to a community, which he may see fit, without being res-
tricted by arbitrary restraints. Incidental to this, he has the right to labor
or employ labor, make contracts in respect thereto upon such terms as the parties
may agree, and to purchase, sell, inherit, sell and convey property of all kinds.
Under the guise of regulation these agreements may not be arbitrarily abridged
(144 N.W. 795).

It will be noted, therefore, that in subdivisions (i) and (k) the prohibited
acts are unlawful only where the effect of such discrimination may be sub-
stantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly, or to injure or des-
troy the business of a competitor.

The act itself is not prohibited (and I might point out in the instant case
that the act of selling the information - the dissemination of the news from
the owner of the wire service to the purchaser thereof - it not itself pro-
hibited - nor is it, unless it can be shown to be "affected with a public
interest" or "clothed with a public use" - subject to the type of regulation
that is proposed: it is the act accompanied by an intent to accomplish a
result made unlawful by the statute (which the legislative body attempted to
correct).

The Court in the foregoing Nebraska case goes on to state that as to subdivision
(j) the element of intent is lacking. The prohibition is against wilful dis-
crimination in favor of one purchaser against another in the respects noted
therein, without reference to the intent or motive of the person so doing.

It is a price fixing statute. It is violative of the holdings heretofore cited
and the constitutional prohibitions hereinabove referred to.

As stated in "STATE vs. RUBACK" (Neb. 28l N.W. 607), "the test to determine
whether a statute defining the offense is void for uncertainty (1) is whether
the language may apply to a particular act about which there can be little
or no difference in opinion, but equally to other acts about which there may
be radical differences, thereby devolving on the Court the exercise of arbi-
trary power as discriminating between the several classes of acts."

There is no question that the business of selling or disseminating the news to
be used in the gambling business is a business "affected with a public interest"
and/or "clothed with a public use."

It is my understanding that nearly fifty per cent or more of the revenue of the
City of Las Vegas is derived frcm gambling businesses, and the City of Las Vegas,
through its Board of City Commissioners, has the authority and power under its
Charter to regulate such a business and to pass an ordinance requiring the
seller thereof to furnish it to all applicants licensed by the City upon the
payment of the fee charged by the seller thereof, without discrimination.

However, the proposed ordinance does not set forth the reason for the particular
regulation and the evil which the regulation intends to overcome, nor does it
prescribe a penalty for violation thereof, and as drawn it is my opinion that
the proposed ordinance is unconstitutional and void.

Respectfully submitted,

WHEREAS, the City of Las Vegas now owns and operates a municipal sewage
disposal system consisting of intercepting sewers, force mains, sewage pumping works
and related facilities; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas has determined
and does hereby determine that said municipal sewage disposal system should be im-
proved and extended by the construction of a sewage disposal plant for the treatment

sewage disposal plant; and

WHEREAS, Emergency Ordinance No. 353 duly adopted by the Board of Commis-
sioners on the 23rd day of April, 1948, as amended and supplemented provided for the

Baskin, Clark, Moore, and Whipple. Also present:	City Manager J. M. Murphy, City Attorney

VACATION OF "A" STREET	This being the time set for the hearing on the vacation of certain portions of "A" Street

AND FIRST STREET	and First Street, Mayor Cragin asked if there was any one present objecting to the vacations.



Mr. Abe Schur, representing the Teacher Building Company stated that they will not object
to the vacation of the portion of "A" Street if the Klines will first deed to the City the
frontage on Charleston Boulevard needed for the construction of the underpass, and if the
portion of "A" Street to be vacated is restricted in its use so that the Klines cannot
construct any building thereon.

Mayor Cragin stated that the Board at present is only concerned with the vacation of a
portion of "A" Street and not with the deeding to the City of the Charleston frontage, and
that he could see no legal way in which the restrictions Mr. Schur demands can be imposed
upon the vacation of a street.

Mr. Schur said that if the vacation is made without any restrictions in its use, the
Teacher Building Company is objecting.

Mr. George Franklin, Jr., Esq., representing Gus and Martha Kline, stated that they are not
in favor of the vacation if there are any conditions or restrictions imposed on the property
to be vacated.

Mr. Schur again stated that the Teacher Building Company is protesting the vacation of Parcel
No. 1 as described in the notice unless the vacation is made with the restriction that no
buildings will be placed on the portion of the street vacated.

At this time the meeting recessed for twenty minutes at the hour of 4:00 P. M.

The meeting reconvened at the hour of 4:20 P.M. with all members present as of the opening
session.

Mr. Abe Schur stated that the Teacher Building Company objects to the vacation of the portion
of "A" Street for any purpose other than parking, and further objects upon the ground that
if parking were permitted in the fifty-five feet of street remaining after vacation, it would
prevent Teacher Building Company, who is the owner of the property on the west side of the
street, from its normal use. He added that the Teacher Building Company will not protest
if the vacation is made with the restriction that no structure be built on the portion of
the street vacated and that it be used only for parking.

Mayor Cragin said that he could not see how there would be any congestion of truck traffic
traffic in the fifty-five feet remaining in "A" Street after the vacation, when the access
road from which traffic was coming into "A" Street was forty feet wide.
334

Thereafter Commissioner Whipple moved that the following order be made:

Board, that the Notice provided for in said Order, a copy of which Notice is attached

And this being the time fixed for the hearing on said Petition for vacation and the
recommendation of the Planning Commission thereon, and this Board having heard evidence
in support of and in opposition to said Petition and recommendation;

And it appearing to the satisfaction of this Board that the portions of the streets

	RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, by Order of the Board of Commissioners a notice was published on the 20th day
of February, 1949, in the Las Vegas Evening Review Journal a daily newspaper of general
circulation printed and published in Las Vegas, in the County of Clark, State of Nevada, of
the intention of the Board to Act upon a resolution reciting the character of the necessity
for and authorizing a temporary emergency loan in the sum of One Hundred Sixty-three Thousand
	Eight Hundred Twenty-eight and 6l/lOOths Dollars ($163,828.61) for the purpose of securing

funds to meet certain accrued and binding indebtednesses and obligations, and necessary
expenditures of the City of Las Vegas, and

WHEREAS, said Board has duly met this day, the 17th day of March, 1949, for the
purpose of acting upon said resolution, and

WHEREAS, no other meeting for the purpose of acting upon said resolution was held by
said Board within the period of fifteen days subsequent to the publication of the afore-
said notice of intention, and no action upon said resolution was held by said Board within
said fifteen day period, and

WHEREAS, no objections by the public, or otherwise, have been made at this meeting of
the Board of Commissioners held this 17th day of March, 1949, or at any time prior thereto,
to the adoption by said Board of said resolution for an emergency loan, and

WHEREAS, the Budget of the City of Las Vegas for the year 1948 included an item of anti-
cipated revenue in the sum of One Hundred and Twenty Thousand Dollars ($120,000) which
consisted of the proceeds of a proposed emergency loan to be made during said budget year, and

WHEREAS, said Budget for the year 1948 was approved by the State Board of Finance of
the State of Nevada, and

WHEREAS, the anticipated expenditures set forth in said Budget were based upon the
reasonable expectation of the full receipt of the anticipated revenues set forth in said
Budget, and

WHEREAS, by reason of a program of further retrenchment and more rigid economic
administration of governmental operations, after the approval of the 191*8 Budget as afore-
said, it was reasonably expected that the anticipated revenues would provide sufficient
funds, without the need for the aforesaid emergency loan, to meet the anticipated expenditures
set forth in said Budget, and

WHEREAS , by reason thereof, no action was taken for the acquisition of said sum of
One Hundred Twenty Thousand Dollars ($l20,000) by an emergency loan, and said sum was not
acquired, and

WHEREAS, at the end of said budget year of 1948 there developed a deficiency in the
receipt of anticipated revenues to the extent of Fifty-one Thousand Three Hundred Forty-
nine and Seventy-nine/100th Dollars ($5l,349.79), consisting of a deficiency of Eighteen Thousand
Five Hundred Twenty-one and 18/l00ths Dollars ($18,521.18) in tax collections, and Thirty-
two Thousand Eight Hundred and Twenty-eight and 6l/100ths Dollars ($32,828.6l) in non-tax
revenues, and

WHEREAS, the City of Las Vegas has incurred a necessary debt in the sum of Forty-five
Thousand Dollars ($45,000) in connection with the surrender of the lease of the Western Air
Lines, Inc. covering the Municipal Airport, and the removal of tanks and gasing facilities
from the Municipal Airport to the Clark County Airport, which is an accrued indebtedness
and binding obligation of said City, and

WHEREAS, the City of Las Vegas has incurred a further indebtedness in the sum of
Seven Thousand One Hundred Eighty-one and 96/lOOths Dollars ($7,181.96) to defray the
necessary construction costs over and above the sum made available therefor by bond issue
for the completion of the storm drainage project of said city, which is an accrued indebted-
ness and binding obligation of said city, and

WHEREAS, the recent unprecedented snow storms caused considerable damage to the streets
and other public ways of the City of Las Vegas, creating therein conditions dangerous to
vehicular and pedestrian traffic which necessitates the immediate expenditure of the sum of
Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000) for repairs, and

WHEREAS, the anticipated revenues of the City of Las Vegas for the year 1949 are
inadequate to meet the aforesaid indebtedness and obligations, and necessary expenditures,
in addition to the current necessary general operating expenses, and

WHEREAS, by reason of the foregoing, a great necessity and emergency exists in connection
with the continued governmental operations of the City of Las Vegas, requiring the immediate
acquisition of the sum of One Hundred Sixty-Three Thousand Eight Hundred Twenty-eight and
6l/100ths Dollars (l63,828.6l) to defray the costs of such continued operations, now, there-
fore, be it

April 22, 1949

ALLIED PRINTING TRADES At this time Mr. Buster Van representing the Allied Printing Trades Council was present at
COUNCIL	the meeting. Mr. Van requested that the Board continue their cooperation in dealing with

	members of the printers union. He also asked that the Board request the union seal on all

	printed matter. His Honor informed Mr. Van that whenever possible union members were asked

to do work for the City, but if printed matter were presented for bid, the Board had no
authority to see that Union printers received the award of the bid unless their bid was low.
Mr. Van stated that he appreciated that fact, but was only asking the Board to request the
union label from union printers. His Honor said, speaking for the Board, he was sure that
they were glad to cooperate in any way possible.

THE WESTERNER - Gaming V. Gray Gubler, Esq. was present representing Catherine & John Horden in their application

for a gaming license for the Westerner. Mr. Gubler stated that the Hordens appreciated the
suggestion of the Board that they might obtain a beverage license and slot machine license,

	but that would be insufficient to support them unless they had either a tavern license or

a Race Horse Book license in addition. After considerable discussion relative to the nec-
essity of either amending or revoking the existing resolution governing the issuance of
gaming licenses Commissioner Clark expressed his views on this resolution. Commissioner
Clark stated that this resolution had been put into effect to assist the gaming industry,
and as far as he was concerned would remain unless the people expressed a desire to have
this resolution stricken from the books. If so, he would personally vote to have this
resolution stricken. However, at this time it would be necessary for him to vote "no" on

LIQUOR APPLICATIONS - NEW At this time Mr. Jack Conlon representing the Tavern Owners Association Wholesale

Liquor and Package Liquor Dealers in the City was present along with representatives
	of the aforementioned businesses. Mr. Conlon respectfully asked that the Board

carefully consider the issuance of any further liquor licenses either package Liquor
or the tavern industry. Mr. Conlon stated that they had available statistics to
show that there are already too many such licenses issued in this community to war-
rant good business.

Mr. Charles B. Schur, applicant for a Retail Tavern License addressed the Board
stating that he felt there should be no limitation on the liquor licenses issued
any more than there should be a limitation on any other types of businesses.

Mr. Wes Barnes, owner and operator of the Sunset Liquor Store spoke at this time
emphasizing the points brought out by Mr. Conlon on the fact that Las Vegas could
not support any more liquor businesses.

Thereafter there was a discussion held by Mr. Greenstein, Wholesale Liquor Dealer
and Mr. John J. De Luca of the same business pointing out the trend of the whole-
sale liquor business at this time. Both these gentlemen requested that the Board
give careful consideration to the issuance of any new liquor licenses.

NEVADA BILTMORE -	At this time a committee of property owners from Biltmore Addition represented by

Liquor and Gaming Licenses Mr. P. A. Clark were present protesting the issuance of liquor and gaming licenses

to S. D. Hunter, Nevada Biltmore Hotel, 600 North Main. Mr. Clark stated that the
	committee was basing their protest on t he grounds that the Nevada Biltmore Hotel

	had sold most of their holdings in the residential area of the Biltmore Addition

and the property owners surrounding the Hotel felt that this type of business would
not be conducive to the welfare and upbringing of their children.

Mr. Harry Claibourne, Esq. representing Mr. S. D. Hunter, applicant for the said
licenses, replied that they felt that this protest was not justifiable since the Hotel
had previously conducted this type of business.

A motion made requesting that the applications for license be denied was withdrawn.
Thereafter the Board requested that a new application be submitted giving in full
the names and addresses of all owners or stockholders.

The City of Las Vegas has encountered unanticipated emergency expenditures occurring on
and soon after the first of January, 1949, as follows:

1.	The purchase of Western Air Lines' leasehold interest and cost
of moving their gassing facilities in order that the Army Air Force

 could occupy exclusively and with unencumbered title the old
McCarren Field, a $45,000 outlay was made.

2.	Construction of the Charleston Boulevard underpass and storm
drain, rights of way for which were guaranteed by the City,

 required $30,000 in cash payments, plus $7,800 in addition for
payment for lateral drains installed by the City.

3.	An unprecedented winter damaged streets to an estimated $200,000
and emergency repairs had to be started soon after the first of the
year.

b. A requested emergency loan in the amount of $163,000 appearing as
 a budget item to balance estimated expenditures was reduced by the
State Board of Finance by $60,000 creating a greater fund shortage.

	5. A last quarter revenue deficiency in 1948 in the amount of

$51,000 depleted the City's carry-over funds.

6. An additional $30,000 necessitated by the passage by the State
 Legislature of a retirement act required City participation in the
amount of 5% of payrolls.

ment facilities covered under Project No. Nev. 26-ll6-F,

NOW, THEREFORE, be it moved by Commissioner Moore that the City of Las Vegas
hereby notifies the United States of America Federal Works Agency of cancellation of

THEREOF ARE ON FILE IN THE OFFICE OF THE CITY CLERK OF THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS, DESCRIBING
DEFINITELY THE LOCATION OF SAID IMPROVEMENTS, STATING THE amount OF THE SAID ASSESSMENT
AND DESIGNATING THE LOCALITY CONSTITUTING THE DISTRICT TO BE ASSESSED ACCORDING TO THE
BENEFITS, AND OTHER MATTERS RELATING THERETO, having been referred on July 7, 1949, to
Commissioners Bunker and Peccole for report, this committee submitted the following recom-
mendation;

"Your committee is of the opinion that the ordinance as prepared is appropriate
and that as a practical business matter it is the duty and obligation of the
City Commission to enact it forthwith and then to see that it becomes operative
in fact, through the proper channels, immediately thereafter.

Your committee is forced to make the following observations based upon inform-
ation and data which came to its attention in the course of its investigation.

It has not been possible yet to ascertain the date upon which completion of this
work was effected - the work order indicates July 7, 1948, the records or recol-
lection of the City Manager's office indicate some date in 1947 and the records
or recollection of the City Light Department Manager, which did the work, indi-
cates another date in 1947. Perhaps this might not be felt important in the
ultimate but it would seem to indicate some lack of coordination between the
functioning bodies of the city which were involved in this project; then again,
a disparity of a year might make a considerable complication to many citizens of
the affected area as hereinafter pointed out.

The work on this project was apparently duly authorized by Ordinance No. 318,
enacted July 22, 1946 and it ultimately involved a considerable expenditure of
labor, material and management, mainly on the part of the City Electric Department
as witness by the final cost bill of $18, 263.94.

This work was completed as above stated at an indeterminate date sometime between
1947 and 1948 or over a year or possibly over two years ago and it is now difficult
for your committee to understand why assessment against the properties and sub-
sequent collection of the amounts due have been so long deferred. In the interim
many properties in the affected areas have changed hands, some no doubt more than
once, and in all such instances, it seems safe to assume, without notice by the
purchasers of any outstanding charges for the work done in this project; it will
no doubt be more difficult for these newer owners to understand why they are now
being assessed for improvements created for one or two years prior to their ac-
quisition of the properties.

The first and only indication of any affirmative action looking toward collection
	of these charges that your committee has been able to find was when the City Comp-

troller is September of 1948 referred the matter to the former City Attorney where
the matter seems to have rested.

Considering the known fact that the City has been under great financial pressure
during the period involved herein and without considering the inconvenience and
possible injustice assessment at this late date may inflict, it seems strange, to
your committee that an account receivable of such size should have been permitted
to hang in suspension and inactive for so long a period without any effort at col-
lection, and that it will cause a considerable disaffection on those now to be
assessed.
432

It would seem that ordinary diligence and practise should apply equally
to municipal as to private management and the dictates of sound business
practise would urge the thought that a serious laxity has heretofore ex-
isted in the prosecution of this important piece of City business. It
seems to your committee that responsibility for this condition must be
placed on those charged with the administration of the affairs of the city
and this must primarily be the city commissioners, and under our form of
administration, the city manager and if there be fault or dereliction
these should be sought out to the end that repetition of these same con-
ditions shall be eliminated as much as possible.

Since all of the matters referred to herein came to pass before the members
of your committee took office it is with some reluctance that they make any
recommendation herein, preferring perhaps, to have the matter decided even in
its preliminary stages before the whole board; however, a sense of obligation
and the urgency that this matter should be met and disposed of prompts the
following recommendations:

1.	That the proposed enabling ordinance be enacted and made op-
erative with all due dispatch, and,

2.	That those who have been charge with the administration of this
matter be required to explain, if now possible, why a matter of
such apparent importance was allowed to drag along unattended
for so long a period and that remedial practices be instituted
forthwith in an attempt to prevent recurrence.

The above entitled ordinance was then read in full to the Board for the first time.

Thereafter Commissioner Peccole moved that Ordinance No. 386 be approved.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Moore and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Bunker, Moore, Peccole and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent: Commissioner Whipple.

OPENING OF BID	This being the time for the opening of bids for the installation of a sanitary sewer in

Thereafter Commissioner Bunker moved that the foregoing bids be referred to the City Mana-
ger and City Attorney for inspection.

SEWER PLANT - New	Commissioner Moore moved that the Mayor be directed to write the following letter to Mr.

Purchase Proposal	Wright Felt, Division Engineer, Bureau of Community Facilities, General Services Admin-

istration in San Francisco, amending the proposal to the Government for the purchase of
the Sewer Plant Project Nev. 26-ll6-F made on June 15, 1949:

Dear Mr. Felt:

My letter of June 15, 1949 to yourself respecting the proposed acquisition by the City of
Las Vegas of the Federally owned sewerage facilities in the City contemplated the issuance
to the Government of certain bonds of the City. You have advised me that the proposal is
acceptable on certain conditions, including the approval of the bonds by the Administrator
of General Services as valid and binding obligations of the City.

The City has had the assistance of Burton and Company of Salt Lake City in handling the
various issues of bonds authorized at the election of May 6, 1947. Burton and Company in
turn employed the firm of Pershing, Bosworth, Dick and Dawson of Denver to prepare the
necessary proceedings and to furnish approving opinions on such bonds. The City has at
all times expected to deliver valid and binding obligations under the proposal of my letter,
and the approving opinion of Pershing. Bosworth, Dick and Dawson will be furnished with the
bonds. I am advised by Mr. Cannon, our City Attorney, that such opinion would necessarily
encompass the purpose for which the bonds are delivered to the government.

The Board of Commissioners, at its meeting today, directed me to amend Paragraphs No. 3
and 4 of the proposal of my letter of June 15 to renegotiate purchase of the sewerage
facilities. In lieu of such paragraphs No. 3 and 4, it is now proposed to deliver to the
Government the remaining $150,000.00 in bonds, plus a cash payment equivalent to the amount
by which the accepted bid for construction of the plant may be less than $550,000.00, in
consideration for the conveyance to the City of all right, title and interest of the
Government in and to the aforesaid sewerage facilities and for the release by the Govern-
ment of all claims or demands it has, or may have, now or hereafter, arising out of any
and all transactions between the Government and the City respecting such sewerage facilities.

The City proposes to deliver bonds in the denomination of $1,000.00 each, maturing in the
amounts and on the dates following:

$4,000.00	July	1,	1950	$4,000.00

$7,000.00	July	1,	1951-56	inclusive	$42,000.00

$8,000.00	July	1,	1957-69	inclusive	$104,000.00

$150,000.00

The City is ready to receive bids for the construction of the new sewerage treatment plant
and to advertise the $200,000.00 of bonds for sale. You are aware of the urgency of the
construction of the sewerage treatment plant, and of the consummation of all action re-
 quired in connection therewith. Consequently we request you prompt action on our proposal,
as amended, and in the completion of the transaction contemplated.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Bunker, Moore, Peccole and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent: Commissioner Whipple.

Thereafter Commissioner Peccole made the following motion;

"I feel that the applications for transfer of a liquor license and the race horse book to the
Howdy Club should be denied at this time and that those licenses should be revoked for the
reason that those licenses were shown inactive for a considerable time. Those owners were
given a chance to put them in use, and they did not, they merely applied for transfer, which
makes it appear they were trafficking in these licenses. I, therefore, move that the appli-
cation for transfer of the liquor licenses of J. K. Houssels to the Howdy Club should be
denied and that the race horse book license from Moe Sedway to the Howdy Club should be
denied, and that those licenses be revoked for non-use."

GAming Denied	are in operation in the specified zone at this time, and the population does not warrant

	more applications.

PETITION OF THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS, NEVADA FOR
RECONSIDERATION, REARGUMENT AND REHEARING OF
THE CIVIL AERONAUTICS BOARD'S DECISION OF JUNE
15, 1949.

The City of Las Vegas, Nevada, an applicant in the consolidated proceeding,
Docket No. 2019 et al., respectfully requests the Civil Aeronautics Board to reconsider
its decision of June 15, 1949, in the subject case which denied the removal of the re-
striction on Transcontinental & Western Air, Inc. (TWA) Route No.2, which prohibits
TWA from engaging in local transportation of persons or property between Las Vegas,
Nevada, and Los Angeles, California. In support of this petition for reconsideration,
reargument and rehearing we submit the following:

1. The people of Las Vegas have long realized the fact that adequate air
transportation, particularly to Los Angeles, is of prime importance to the business
of this community. In a sincere effort to obtain adequate air transportation to Los
446

Angeles, the City of Las Vegas, with the complete support of the Las Vegas Chamber
of Commerce and the Commissioners of Clark County, originally applied to the Civil
Aeronautics Board on May 12, 1947, requesting the removal of the restriction which
prohibits TWA from offering local service between las Vegas, and Los Angeles, This
application of the City of Las Vegas was assigned Docket No. 2933 by the Civil Aer-
onautics Board and was later consolidated in Docket No. 2019, the Additional Cali-
fornia-Nevada Service Case. The City of Las Vegas, in its sincere effort to obtain
removal of this unrealistic restriction, participated in all of the necessary pro-
cedural steps with the Civil Aeronautics Board and developed a strong record show-
ing the absolute necessity for the removal of the restriction.  This record, in sup-
port of the removal of the restriction, removes absolutely any possible reason for
maintaining the restriction. This case involved may complicated and debatable issues
but the Board has seen fit to maintain the restriction despite the fact that the re-
cord does not support the restriction. The restriction is not a debatable issue. It
is a clear-cut uneconomic and unrealistic handicap to the transportation requirements
of this community and the financial obligations this community has undertaken to ob-
tain adequate air transportation.

2.	The record in this case proves beyond a doubt that Las Vegas has its
greatest community of interest by far with Los Angeles, yet the Board inposes an
obstacle in the form of this restriction between Las Vegas and the point of our great-
est community of interest. Los Angeles is the primary market with which Las Vegas has
historically and economically conducted all phases of its business transactions. Los
Angeles is our main source of foodstuffs, building materials, manufactured products,
and banking services. Los Angeles, likewise, is our largest customer in our very im-
portant tourist business as is evidenced by the high percentage of Los Angeles visitors
registered in our hotels.

3.	The City of Las Vegas spent a considerable amount of money and time in
participating in this case because the restriction, which fosters a monopoly, and which
is contrary to the development of this community, should be removed. Our citizens and
our visitors continually complain of the fact that they cannot obtain air transportation
between Las Vegas and Los Angeles, and at the same time planes are operating between Las
Vegas and Los Angeles with empty seats. This deplorable situation cannot be justified.

The resort hotels in this area are nationally famous for their service and the
facilities that they offer. These resort hotels, as well as other business in this area
are restricted in their development by the restriction on air transportation as surely
as if there were an imposed restriction to the number of rooms that they could offer to
the traveling public. The Civil Aeronautics Board may not realize the fact, but it is
nevertheless true, that the hotel and resort businesses require a high percentage of
occupancy just as the airlines require a high occupancy of their available seats. The
business interests of Las Vegas spend vast sums of money annually on promotional acti-
vities in all parts of the United States, and particularly in Los Angeles, to attract
visitors to this community. We know that a large percentage of this promotional work is
being wasted if there is anything which restricts people from traveling to and from Las
Vegas. The restriction on air transportation is a direct restriction on the business
interests in this community just as definitely as if the individual businesses were
named in the restriction.

4.	The Civil Aeronautics Board, in its decision, mentioned "public detriment."
We in Las Vegas have a perfect example of public detriment resulting from the restriction
on air transportation. When the United States Government advised Las Vegas and Clark
County that they wished to have exclusive use of the existing army Air Base in Las Vegas,
which also served as a municipal airport for Las Vegas and Clark County, the citizens of
this community approved a million dollar bond issue by a ten-to-one Vote to finance our
share in the development of the new McCarran Airport. This airport, in operation today,
represents and investment of $1,600,000 of the taxpayers' money, both federal and local.
The ten-to-one vote by which the bond issue was passed, is positive proof that the cit-
izens of this community fully realize the importance of adequate air transportation to
the continued economic development of this area. Likewise, our citizens are good business
men and cannot afford to, and do not intend to, finance "white elephants." Any restriction
which prohibits the development of the necessary revenues to make this airport attain its
proper function as a public service rather than as a public financial liability, is con-
trary to the public welfare.

5. The restrictions, as it applies today to air transportation in Las Vegas,
not only prohibits the developments of our business potential with the Los Angeles area,
but in addition restricts our business relationships with many important communities to
the East. Our hotel registrations show that we have a substantial number of visitors
from the eastern part of the United States. Air service is available to these important
communities, but it is likewise restricted in quantity due to the fact that the airlines
logically cannot afford to operate their transcontinental schedules through Las Vegas
in any appreciable number when they are forced to fly all these schedules with empty
seats between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. We have heard and read a great deal about the
subject of airline subsidies. The Civil Aeronautics Board should be interested in re-
moving the restriction which prohibits airlines from carrying passengers when these
passengers are readily and constantly available. Just how the Civil Aeronautics Board
can justify such a contradictory state of affairs is beyond comprehension.

The same factors which have motivated the local resort businesses to carry
on extensive promotional advertising campaigns have resulted in the airlines' adoption
of family fare plans and similar promotional activities to develop their business. The
local hotels and resorts have their heaviest traffic on weekends, and they would most
certainly welcome the full benefits of the family fare plan to stimulate their business
in the first part of each week. The restriction has resulted in discrimination against
local Los Angeles - Las Vegas passengers. The benefits of the family fare plan are
available to our citizens and visitors to every point to which we have air service ex-
cept to Los Angeles and to the points on Western Air Lines system where they furnish the
only air service available. The removal of the restriction would automatically term-
inate this discrimination.

6.	No one can explain to the satisfaction of our visitors or our citizens
why they cannot obtain air transportation to Los Angeles when seats are available.

The traveling public objects to their restriction so thoroughly that they resort to
447

subterfuge to obtain their rights. The traveling public is continually buying tickets
to all points on the compass to avoid the restriction. Obviously this results in con-
fusion, misunderstanding, and a waste of time and money for all parties concerned.

The Civil Aeronautics Board, by maintaining the restriction, is encouraging the voi-
lation of its own rules and regulations.

The existing air service between Las Vegas and Los Angeles is wholly in-
adequate to meet the requirements of the travelling public. The frequency of service
and the seats available have been on the decline for the past several years, and there
has been shown little disposition to stimulate the traffic. The only permanent cure to
this situation is to provide a competing service.

The City of Las Vegas respectfully pray your honorable Board, under the pert-
inent sections of the Civil Aeronautics Act, as amended, to grant its petition for re-
consideration, reargument, and rehearing of the City's application for the removal of
the restrictions on TWA's Route 2 which prohibits the carriage of local passengers and
property between Las Vegas and Los Angeles. Throughout this case, it has never been the
City's intention to support or oppose an individual airline but rather to direct the
City's efforts to correcting a situation which is contrary to public convenience and
necessity.

Respectfully submitted,

and the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, (herein called the "City"), witnesseth:

1.	Whenever used in this Contract:

(a)	The term "Project" shall mean the war housing developed by the Federal

administered as low-rent housing within the City by the Authority.

(b)	The term "Taxing Bodies" shall mean the State and every political sub-

The provisions of this contract shall be applicable in respect to the
Project in the event of such acquisition.

3.	The Project and the Authority being exempt from all taxes (and special	

assessments) under the Constitution and Statutes of the State of Nevada,	

the Authority shall make payments (herein called the "PILOT") to the	

City in lieu of such taxes and special assessments and in payment for

municipal services and facilities furnished for or with respect to the
Project, as follows:

(a)	For the period from the day following the end of the tax year,
the lien date of which was the last tax lien date preceding

the date of conveyance of the Project to the Authority, to the	

close of the then current Project fiscal year and for each of	

the next succeeding two Project fiscal years the PILOT shall	HE

be in an amount equal to the greater of either (1) all income

of the Project, less (i) operating expenses (including reserves,

but excluding the PILOT) of the Project, and less (ii) an

amount computed at the rate of $17,476.00 per annum, or (2) ten

per cent (10%) of Shelter Rents, earned during such period or

fiscal year, as the case may be;

(b)	For each succeeding Project fiscal year and continuing to a date forty-

that there will be available in each year for pilot, an amount at least equal to 10%
of Shelter Rents.	

The City shall distribute the PILOT among the Taxing Bodies in the proportion which	

the real property taxes otherwise payable to each Taxing Body bear to the sum of the real
property taxes of all Taxing Bodies which would otherwise be levied against the Project;

made to any Taxing Body including the City in excess of the amount of the real property
taxes which would have been paid to such Taxing Body for such period or year, as the
case may be, if the Project were not exempt from taxation.

Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, no PILOT shall be made for any period
or year which would exceed the amount permitted to be paid by the laws of the State for
such period or year.

4.	During the period commencing with the date of the conveyance of the Project to the

RESOLUTION NO. 104

WHEREAS, the Government of the United States of America, during the recent war time
emergency, constructed, acquired and established Sewer War Public Works facilities identified
os Project No. Nev. 26-116-F and consisting generally of a disposal plant, pipes, pipelines,
accessories and facilities for the conveyance of sewage, together with certain lands or
interests in lands, in or near the City of Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada, and

WHEREAS, the Government of the United States of America, by instrument in writing
dated July 1, 1946, leased the aforesaid Project to the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, and by
provision in said instrument granted to said City the option, during the original term of
said lease, or any renewal thereof, to purchase all of the Government's right, title and
interest in and to the leased property for the agreed and stipulated consideration of the
principal sum of Three Hundred Twenty Thousand Dollars ($320,000.00), less the amount of all
rental payments made under said lease, plus interest computed at the rate of three per cent
(3%) per annum on the principal sum or balances thereof, and

WHEREAS, the City of Las Vegas is now considering the acquisition of all of the Govern-
ments' right, title and interest in and to the aforesaid Project, by and through its exercise
of the option aforesaid, and

WHEREAS, a technical engineering investigation now discloses that the sewer works of
said Project have depreciated at a far greater rate than that anticipated at the time of the
execution of the option agreement aforesaid and assumed as the basis for the fixation of a
fair valuation of said Project to be paid by the City of Las Vegas upon the exercise of its
option to purchase the same, and

WHEREAS, in the light of the facts, revealed by said investigation, that deterioration
in said sewer works is progressing at a spiraling rate, resulting in an excessively increased
flow of infiltrated ground waters, necessitating the additional fixed cost of treating the
same, and that the utility life of said works is consequently considerably shorter than that
contemplated at the time of the execution of said option agreement, obviously requiring an
earlier retirement and replacement of said works, it now appears that the valuation of said
Project as reflected in the consideration expressed in the option agreement for the purchase
of said Project by the City of Las Vegas failed to take into account circumstances sub-
sequently developing and unforeseen at the time of said agreement which would have materially
effected a reduced and more accurate and equitable valuation, and

WHEREAS, it was the intention of the parties at that time to express a consideration
which reflected a reasonably accurate, fair and equitable valuation of said Project, now,
therefore, be it

RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, in regular session this
29th day of September, 1947, that it respectfully urge and request the Government of the United
States of America, through its duly constituted agencies, to re-open and re consider the question
of the valuation of the Project aforesaid, and join with the City of Las Vegas in an examination
of all the facts and circumstances now known or available having any bearing upon a determination
of a more accurate, fair and equitable consideration to be paid by said City upon the exercise
of its option to purchase said Project.

1.8% short of said passing grade, and

missioners of said City, during the enforced and unavoidable absences of the City Attorney,

Attorney's office, acting for and on behalf of said City, would benefit said City appreciably,
and be of particular value in facilitating the expeditious disposition of the increased
volume of legal work in the City Attorney's office, and

WHEREAS, this Board is confident that, if admitted as an attorney, he will continue
in the service of the city government and conscientiously and efficiently perform and
discharge the duties assigned to him by the City Attorney, and

WHEREAS, this Board is further confident that by reason of his excellent moral
character and reputation, he will be a credit to the legal profession and the community if
admitted as an attorney in this state, now, therefore, be it

RESOLVED, by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, Clark County,

Nevada, in session this 26th day of November, 1947, that it respectfully request and urge
the Honorable Supreme Court of the State of Nevada and the Board of Bar Examiners of the

by him on the examination aforesaid merit the additional 1.8% needed by him to attain the
passing grade of 75% on said examination, and upon such reconsideration that his application
for admission be granted if such passing grade is attained, and be it further

RESOLVED, that the City Clerk be and she is hereby directed to forward a copy of this

WHEREAS, the City of Las Vegas, like most communities in the United States, is
confronted with the problem of a serious housing shortage, and

an expanded period of time before such loans may be consummated and necessarily resulting in
the delay of essential construction, now, therefore, be it

RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, at a recessed regular
520

meeting thereof held on the 8th day of December, 1947, that it respectfully urge upon the

where such applications may be acted upon and disposed of with finality, and be it further

RESOLVED that the City Clerk be and she is hereby ordered and directed to forward a copy
of this resolution to the Federal Housing Administration in Washington, D. C. and to the members

RESOLUTION 185

Commissioner Moore introduced and moved the adoption of the following resolution:

WHEREAS, the Housing Authority of the City of Las Vegas, hereinafter referred to as the
"Authority" was duly organized under the Nevada Housing Authorities Act by a resolution of
the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, hereinafter referred to as the "City,"
passed and adopted on the 6th day of June, 1947;

WHEREAS, in contemplation of the construction by the Authority of a low-rent housing project
within the corporate limits of the City, the Authority and the City entered into a Cooperation
Agreement on the 26th day of October, 1949;

WHEREAS, in connection with the proposed low-rent housing project, the City in Paragraph 6 (b)
of said Cooperation Agreement agreed as follows:

"In respect to any Project the City further agrees that within a reasonable
time after receipt of a written request from the Local Authority:

"(b) it will accept necessary dedications of land for, and will grade,
improve, pave, and provide sidewalks for, all streets bounding such
Project or necessary to provide adequate access thereto (in consideration
whereof the Local Authority shall pay to the City such amount as would
be assessed against the Project site for such work if it were privately
owned)."

WHEREAS, pursuant to application of the Authority, the Public Housing Administration has
approved a program reservation for one hundred (100) dwelling units for the  proposed low-
rent housing project in the City;

WHEREAS, the Authority has started negotiations for and contemplates purchasing approx-
imately twenty (20) acres of ground on the Westside, Las Vegas, Nevada commonly known
as the Harper Property, as a site for the proposed low-rent project;

WHEREAS, under the proposed improvement plan for the said site, the project will be bounded
by three streets, namely H. Street on the East, Washington Avenue on the North, and
McWilliams Street on the South;

WHEREAS, the Authority has requested that the City improve, pave and provide sidewalks for
the above-mentioned three streets bounding the proposed project, concurrently with the
construction of the proposed project by the Authority, and in consideration whereof, the
Authority has agreed to pay the City such amount as would be assessed against the project
site for such improvement work if the said property were privately owned;

WHEREAS, THE City recognizes the obligation under the above-mentioned Cooperation Agreement
but is unable to fulfill its obligations with respect to the three bounding streets at the
present time for the following reasons:
554

(a)	The customary method of paving streets and providing sidewalks 

and other improvements in the City is to create an
assessment district with the property on each side of the
street bearing one-half of the cost of improvements. In
the case of streets bounding the proposed project the
private property abutting the said streets on the opposite
sides is not high enough in value to support an assessment
district and pay its one-half share of improvements.

(b)	The City does not have general funds presently budgeted and
available for such street improvements.

WHEREAS, in view of the inability of the City to presently fulfill its obligations
under the Cooperation Agreement with respect to the said bounding streets, the Authority
is willing, in connection with its overall construction program, to provide sidewalks for
and pave one-half of the above-mentioned three bounding streets, provided the City will:

(a)	On or before the completion of the proposed project gravel
and oil coat the other one-half of the said streets.

(b)	On or before July 1, 1953, either by assessment or through

funds provided in the regular budget, complete the paving	'

of the remaining one-half of the said three bounding streets.	

WHEREAS, since the cost to the Authority for paving one-half of the three bounding streets
in connection with its overall construction program will be approximately the sane amount
as if the City paved all of said streets and assessed the Authority for its share, the
Authority should not be assessed any further amounts by the City when the said City
completes the other one-half of the paving;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED:	That if the Authority acquires the approximate twenty

(20) acres on the Westside, and commonly known as the Harper Property, and constructs thereon
a low-rent housing project and in connection therewith provides sidewalks and paves one-
half of the three bounding streets known as H Street, Washington Avenue and McWilliams
Street, that the City will:

1.	On or before the completion of said project gravel and oil coat
the other half of said streets.

2.	On or before July 1, 1953, either by assessment or through funds provided

in the regular budget, pave the remaining one-half of the said throe streets
bounding the project.

many years, and

human qualities of kindness, tolerance and understanding he found everlasting endear-

family may well take consolation in the knowledge that their husband and father was
loved by all and that no other can fill the place he found in the hearts of his friends.
