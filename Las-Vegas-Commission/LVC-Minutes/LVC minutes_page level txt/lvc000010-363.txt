Mr. Harry Claiborne appeared at this time on behalf of Messrs. Albert and David Mengarelli
in their request to reopen the Log Cabin Bar at 122 North 1st Street which has been closed
since April 11, 1956.

The Commission questioned Mr. Albert Mengarelli as to who would be responsible for the opera-
tion of this business in the event the suspension is lifted. Mr. Mengarelli advised the Board
that he would be in complete charge if that was their desire and that his brother David would
take care of the parking lots they own.

Thereafter Commissioner Bunker moved that the suspension of the tavern license for the Log
Cabin Bar at 122 North 1st Street be lifted and this license issued to Albert Mengarelli,
subject to this building being brought up to code.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

The Commission considered the application of Twin Lakes Shopping Center, Inc. to rezone all
of that portion of the NW¼ of the SE¼ of Section 29-20-61 which lies east of the Tonopah
Highway from R-1 to C-1.

Planning Director Franklin Bills reported that this application had been approved by the
Planning Commission, and the matter deferred from the City Commission meeting of September
19, 1956 to check on the fact that two parcels of land in this area proposed to be rezoned
did not belong to the Twin Lakes Shopping Center. Mr. Bills stated that one of the parcels
in question is owned by Mr. Phil Shanedling who is one of the principals in the Twin Lakes
Shopping Center, and the other property is owned by M. M. Sweeney and John Pappas who have
given written indication of their desire to have this property rezoned C-1.

Mr. Louis Wiener, Jr. and Mr. Francis Wakley were present on behalf of the applicant and
requested approval so that the proposed shopping center can proceed.

The Commission questioned Messrs. Weiner and Wakley on whether or not the Twin Lakes
Shopping Center actually intended to develop this project or whether they might sell the prop-
erty to someone else in the event it is rezoned. The Commission was advised that Twil Lakes
Shopping Center definitely intended to go ahead with the project as planned.

The representatives of the applicant were further questioned concerning the installation of
off-site improvements, and indicated they would be willing to enter into an agreement to
install whatever the City required.

Thereafter Commissioner Fountain moved this application for rezoning be approved subject to
the applicant entering into an agreement for the installation of off-site improvements, filing
of a bond, completion of the improvements within six months, and the developing of the pro-
posed project according to a plan to be submitted and approved by the Board of Commissioners.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote: Commissioners

Bunker, Fountain, Sharp and His Honor voting ay; noes, none. Commissioner Whipple passed his vote.

Consideration was given to the application of Ray Smith for rezoning of property beginning at
the NE corner of the NE¼ of the SW¼ of Sec. 33-20-61, running along the centerline of Section
33, southerly 1839.46', thence westerly 304.31', thence northerly 518.70', thence westerly
1015.88', thence northerly 660.61½', less 30', thence easterly 330.00', thence northerly 660.61½',
thence easterly 992.15' to the true point of beginning from R-1 to M-1, which was denied by
the Planning Commission.

Commissioner Bunker moved the recommendation of the Planning Commission be accepted, and this
application for rezoning denied.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

The Commission considered the recommendation of the Planning Commission to rezone Blocks C
and D of the Beverly Green Tract from R-1 to R-4, which was an error when the Land Use Map
was adopted December 7, 1953. Mr. Bills advised the Commission that the Planning Commission
determined the properly is best suited for development as multiple family housing.

Thereafter Commissioner Sharp moved the recommendation of the Planning Commission be accepted
and Blocks C and D of Beverly Green Tract be rezoned from R-1 to R-4.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

At this time the Commission considered the application of O. W. Clark for rezoning of property

thence North 347.3', thence east 100'; thence south 347.5'; thence west 100' to the point of

dation of the Planning Commission to rezone property beginning at a point that is 694.52' north
and 60' east of the S¼ corner of Sec. 35-20-61; thence north 130'; thence east 100; thence
south 130'; thence west 100' to the point of beginning from C-2 to R-4.

Mr. William SingLeton, representing Mr. Clark, advised the Commission that the application
