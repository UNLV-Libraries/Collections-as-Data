This being the time heretofore set for the continuance of the public hearing on the appli-
cation of Will Max Schwartz for variance to construct and maintain a casino,
bar and entertainment dining room in conjunction with a resort hotel on property
located at 900 West Bonanza Road, to be known as Moulon Rouge, the matter
was considered by the Board.

The intentions of Will Max Schwartz Associates (Bisno and Bisno) as set
forth in a letter from Thomas A. Foley, dated March 24, and March 29, 1954,
was read to the Board.

Mr. Milton Keefer appeared before the Board at this time, stating that his
clients were still opposed to having gaming and liquor in this area.

Commissioner Bunker moved this application of Will Max Schwartz Associates
for variance to construct and maintain a casino, bar and entertainment
dining room in conjunction with a resort hotel at 900 West Bonanza be
approved and the following stipulations be incorporated and made a part
of the minutes:

1.	My clients intend to construct a luxury hotel on that
certain parcel of land located West of "H" Street on the West side of the
City of Las Vegas, Nevada, likedned, in all respects, insofar as construction

is concerned, to the present existing luxury hotels that we have on our "Strip"
within the County of Clark. That the basic cost of construction alone is
estimated to be in excess of $907,000.00, and, with the inclusion of the neces-
sary expenses of furnishing and landscaping, to approximate a cost of
$1,200,000.00; said hotel to be constructed with a setback of at least 140
feet from the center line of West Bonanza Road.

2.	If the variance requested by my clients is granted,
immediate action will be taken by them to commence the construction. This
may be assured because of the nature of the life of a variance, which is six
months, and if construction is not under way by the passage of that time then
the matter will be foreclosed, unless, of course, the delay is caused by an
Act of God or other uncontrollable source, which would be a basis for an
extension.

3.	Preliminary plans, perspectives, drawings and designs,
etc., which have been completed and have heretofore been submitted to both
the Planning Commission and to this Board of Commissioners have been accepted
and approved by the principals.

4.	From the granting of the variance, the plans and speci-
fications will be presented to the Building Department of the City of Las
Vegas within at least ninety (90) days therefrom.

5.	Immediately upon receipt of the Building Permit, bids
will be let locally for the construction of the said luxury hotel.

6.	That the principals, my clients, have not as of this
time selected the person or persons who will operate the gaming but, in
this connection, state that the names or named will be submitted to this
Honorable Board before application is made for gaming licenses.

7.	That the principals, the applicants herein, declare their
intention, and by these presents do declare, that they will construct the
said Moulin Rouge luxury hotel and operate the same thereafter, and state
clearly and unequivocally that this project is not, and will not be, a
stock promotion.

8.	That Will Schwartz Associates (Bisno & Bisno), do, by
these presents, declare their intention to exercise their option on that
parcel of land to the rear of the land upon which the variance application
is pending, being a parcel of approximately 5-l/2 acres, which may be des-
cribed as that portion of land abutting McWilliams Street, directly across
from Marble Manor.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, Commissioner
Jarrett. Commissioner Sharp passed his vote, stating that his firm was the
architect for this property.

Commissioner Jarrett stated his reason for voting "no" was because he was
 against any gaming and liquor in this area.

Company for $.2203 Standard and $.2423 Ethyl.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote:

5-10-54
WHEREAS, said assessment roll has been filed and is now ready for con-
firmation; and

WHEREAS, there have been many protests on the cost of construction of
the improvements in this district; and

WHEREAS, it is felt that the district should be abandoned at this
time without prejudice to any future action which may be taken.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the
City of Las Vegas at a recessed regular meeting held on the 10th day of
May, 19%, that the assessment roll heretofore prepared for Assessment
District No. 100-26, be and the same is hereby rejected, and all further

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye;
noes, none.

City Manager George Rounthwaite presented the proposed contract with Carl
Belding for concession rights at the City Ball Park, Swimming Pool and
Cashman Field. Mr. Rounthwaite explained that the Recreation Department
& Comptroller had studied this matter and requested the City Attorney to
prepare said contract for presentation to the Commission; he further stated
that bids had been requested from concessionaires and had been received
from Mr. Belding and two others. The recommendation of the City Manager
was that Mr. Belding's bid was the best bid and should be accepted.

Thereafter Commissioner Bunker moved the recommendation of the City Manager
be accepted and the Mayor and Clerk authorized to sign said contract.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Jarrett and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Jarrett, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none,
Commissioner Sharp passed his vote.

City Manager George Rounthwaite recommended that the bid of Schramm, Inc.
for an engine driven compressor for the Woodlawn Cemetery, designated as
Bid No. 54.11 opened by the Board of Commissioners on April 21, 1954, be
accepted. Mr. Rounthwaite stated that this bid was the low bid in the
amount of $1500.00 and met the specifications called for.

Commissioner Whipple asked if any of the bids submitted by inland Service
would meet our needs. Thereafter Mr. Rounthwaite requested additional
time for report on this matter later in this meeting.

Commissioner Whipple moved the minutes of April 21, 23 and 26, 1954, be
approved by reference and the Mayor and City Clerk authorized to sign same.

At this time the recommendation of the Civil Service Board of Trustees
concerning the realignment of salary scheduled in the Police Department
was presented for consideration.

and prepare a better alignment between the Police and Fire Departments
that the following adjustments be made:

1.	Patrolman salary be raised from Schedule 20 to
Schedule 21.

2.	Sergeant salary be raised from Schedule 22 to
Schedule 23.

3.	Lieutenant salary be raised from Schedule 23 to
Schedule 24.

Commissioner Jarrett moved that the recommendation of the Civil Service
Board with reference to the realignment of salaries in the Police Depart-
ment be approved, effective May 1, 1954.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye;
noes, none.

The application of Harry Dillon for a Tavern Liquor License at the Sham-
rock Hotel, Main and Bonanza for the second quarter of 19% was presented
for consideration.

Chief A. H. Kennedy verified that Mr. Dillon had been cleared by the Police
Department, and discussion was held concerning whether or not Mr. Dillon
had a lease on the bar. Chief Kennedy stated that he understood that Mr.
Dillon would be willing to sign an agreement that the license would stay
at this location.

Commissioner Jarrett asked if the Board could amend the ordinance so that
liquor licenses could not be transferred out of hotels.

The City Attorney advised that this could be accomplished by amendment to
the ordinance or as a policy matter.

His Honor stated that if said license is granted it would be with the under-
standing that the license is not transferable.

No action was taken on Mr. Dillons application at this time.

Thereafter the Board considered the request concerning instructions for col-
lecting money due on two checks deposited by Clem Malone at the time he
held the lease for the Shamrock Hotel.

Thereafter Commissioner Bunker moved the City Attorney be instructed to
proceed with any legal action necessary to collect the $675.00 from Clem
Malone.

The City Attorney advised the Commission that the bad checks returned on
the Shamrock Hotel license could only be collected through bankruptcy,
if Malone has filed for bankruptcy, unless the Commission sees fit to
hold up issuing a license at this location until the checks are made
good.

Commissioner Bunker's motion died for lack of a second.

Commissioner Whipple moved the application of Harry Dillon for a tavern
liquor license at the Shamrock Hotel be approved subject to Police De-

A special meeting of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas,
Nevada held this 13th day of May, 1954, was called to order at the hour
of 9:00 A.M. by His Honor Mayor Baker with the following members present:

Mayor	C. D. Baker

Commissioner	Wendell Bunker

City Attorney	Howard	W. Cannon

City Clerk	Shirley Ballinger

Absent:	Commissioner	Harris	P. Sharp

City Manager	George	Rounthwaite

Also Present:

Mr. Simon Perliter
Mr. L. E. Tyson

Discussion was held on the Ralph O. Dixson Sewer Contract. Thereafter
Commissioner Bunker asked Mr. Simon Perliter, engineer for the City for
City-wide sewer improvement program, what his recommendation was on the
proposed negotiations with the Estate of Ralph O. Dixson, and requested
that Mr. Perliter's statements be made a matter of record.

Mr. PERLITER - First, I do not know what the $42,000.00 is for. I did
not participate in the negotiating, so I do not know
what it covers directly. In a general way I know the
details of what should be paid —approximately $16,000.00
was for extras due to line change on Rancho Road; the
rest I never did get straight, and for what reason.

MR. CANNON - The settlement itself, if it is made would do these

things. It would result in a dismissal with prejudice
of the action brought by Ralph O. Dixson against the
City. It would be a waiver of all rights for any com-
pensation by reason of water or any other soil conditions
in connection with the sewer completed to date. It would
be consideration with the bonding company to complete
the balance of the project, relieving the City of any
liability by reason of change of line on Rancho Road
sewer and any claim for extras. But on the further con-
dition that the bonding company proceed under their bond
to pay the claims incurred by reason of the Dixson Sewer
Contract, which are believed to be in excess of $100,000.00.
Further that the bonding company waive any additional
compensation by reason of soil conditions, including water
on the remaining portion of the contract to be completed.

MAYOR BAKER - What is the approximate amount the bonding company is
contributing?

MR. CANNON - The situation is this— the water claim of $16,000.00

and the bonding company would have to pay all creditor's
claims and in addition, $60,000.00 for completion of the
contract.

MR. WHIPPLE - Plus unpaid bills.

MR. JARRETT - Is the Estate bankrupt?

MR. CANNON - This is the representation made to me. The Estate is not
bankrupt, but practically insolvent and the bonding
company agreed that if this proposal is worked out to
their satisfaction, they will not make any claim against
the Estate— Mr. Dixson has left a wife and two children
with less than $1,000.00 and assets of an undetermined
value— the bonding company agreed that on a basis of
satisfactory arrangement they will not make any claim or
take over equipment.

5-13-54
Mr. Perliter was asked for his recommendation

MR. PERLITER - My answer is this— if this suit will delay this pro-
ject a considerable length of time, then it is a
matter of balance; the first is the proposal for
$42,000.00. If you can continue, I would say to
fight. In regard to the information I have fur-
nished concerning borings, if it is wrong, and
there is no proof it's wrong; the very fact of
the point that the borings were in and I used
those borings to determine my $658,000.00 estimate
is proof, I should know how to figure on a unit
price basis.

If the project is going to be delayed an indefinite
number of months, that should be balanced against
$42,000.00 that is claimed. One other way to look
at it, and that is thie—the cost to the City of
$42,000.00 added to the $518,000.00 bid by Dixson
totals $560,000.00. That is not in line with the
average of all bids received— I still think the
City is saving approximately $100,000.00 of what
would be a legitimate price for the Sewer. As
far as my intent was concerned, I did my best— I
visited the project while the borings were going
on to see what progress was being made.

MR. JARRETT -	Do you feel you have any financial obligation to

the City for the mistakes you have made?

MR. PERLITER - I still do not have any proof on my borings.

MAYOR BAKER -	In the matter of a lawsuit, would you decide, or

is there a meeting ground where you would be
willing to negotiate to pay a portion of the
$42,000.00?

At this point the question on the reliability of Mr. Perliter's choice

of Contractor to perform the "borings" was raised.

MR. PERLITER - I do know there are two large companies in California

that do borings with their own force, and yet there
has been cases where a contractor has challenged
their borings. As this was explained, I got the in-
formation that the Contractor will always attack it
if he is in a spot. However, the cost to the tax-
payer is less than if we didn't have it. I do have
the recommendation of what the man gave me trans-
ferred into the borings.

Discussion was then held with City Engineer George Wade on the percentage

of the project completed to date on Schedules A, B and C of the Sewer

Improvement Program.

MAYOR BAKER -	I believe there should be some consideration made

by Perliter for the reasons stated— just for a
figure, in the neighborhood of $5,000.00, not to
argue, but to get a basis to work on.

MR. BUNKER -	I would be satisfied, myself.

MR. JARRETT -	I don't think it's enough.

MR. WHIPPLE -	To get back to the point, if we should tell Cannon

to stop negotiations, and we lose, what would be
your reaction?

MR. PERLITER -	I advise not to negotiate on a basis of what is

finished— to take it to Court.

MR. WHIPPLE -	Do you advise the City to go ahead and fight

through the Court:

MR. PERLITER - One point's got me worried, since one of the men

who made the borings cannot be located— his name
is Lawler. I could not foresee that this man was
going to disappear. If that man cannot be located,
it is, I understand, a vital factor toward the
settlement. Speaking for myself, I went to a
legitimate operator, George E. Miller— I did not
chisel around, and he said he could do it. I had
been working with him for two to two and a half
years, so I contracted with him to do this work.

MAYOR BAKER -	This was poor judgment on your part.

MR. BUNKER -	It is evident that you refuse to answer whether

we should fight or settle.

MR. PERLITER -	I will answer— if I was put up on a stand, my

answer would be "yes", and if asked if my allotted

5-13-54
ASSESSMENT DISTRICT
No. 100-27

Construction bids

information was right, I would say "yes". In view of
the fact that we have not been able to make contact
with one of the men who made the borings or find him,
and since in line with the City Attorney's informa-
tion that the man would be a necessary witness, I
would say, go ahead and settle.

MR. WHIPPLE -	Is it worth anything to you to renegotiate, percentage-

wise or proportionately, the fees the City agreed to
pay you?

MR. PERLITER -	I am a professional man, an engineer, and I do not

want to go to Court. One point I would like to settle
is that such a low bid has required additional ex-
pense to me. I had to do a lot more work than I had
contemplated. I want to work with the City and I
still feel suited to carry the job to completion. I
never have had a bad job yet.

MR. WHIPPLE -	Wade and Perliter should get together and work out

one or two objects for renegotiating and then have a
full Board present and meet on it.

MR. PERLITER -	I would like time to think about the $5,000.00 figure

and talk to my attorney.

MR. WHIPPLE -	I think it is important to get this done as soon as

possible, and would like to see both items taken care
of at the same time.

MR. PERLITER -	My work is as good as anything, without signing. I

will give you an answer tomorrow and will be here
to explain.

MAYOR BAKER -	Let the City Manager know.

MR. BUNKER -	Are you able to indemnify the City against any loss?

MR. PERLITER -	I do not know.

MR. BUNKER -	$5,000.00 settlement is fine.

Mr. L. E. Tyson, engineer for Assessment District No. 100-27, reported to
the Board on the low bidders for the installation of improvements in said
District. No action was taken at this time.

Thereafter, there being no further business to come before the Board at
this special meeting, the meeting adjourned.

water during most of the daylight hours; and

WHEREAS, the lack of water has not yet but may create a serious
public health problem for the entire community; and

WHEREAS, it is expected that the critical situation in those areas
not now receiving adequate water will be alleviated by June 1, 1954, by
the addition of a new water line; and

5-19-54
WHEREAS, the Board of City Commissioners believes that the citizens
of the City of Las Vegas will gladly take voluntary conservation measures
in the use of water so that thei neighbors in the City who are less
fortunate, may have sufficient water during the daytime to attend to the
common necessities of life.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Board of Commissioners of
the City of Las Vegas that all residents of the City of Las Vegas are

ment will be likewise deleted. This system will be put in at the time of

City's General Fund.

Thereafter George Wade, City Engineer discussed with the Commission the contract the

A recessed regular meeting of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas
Nevada held this 7th day of June, 1954, was called to order at the hour of
4:15 P.M. by His Honor Mayor Baker with the following members present:

Mayor	C. D. Baker

Commissioner	Wendell Bunker

Commissioner	Rex A.	Jarrett

Commissioner	Harris	P.	Sharp

City Manager	George	H.	Rounthwaite

Asst. City Mgr.	Robert	W.	Notti

Asst. City Atty Ralston O. Hawkins
City Engineer	George Wade

This being the time heretofore set for the continuation of the public hearing
 on the application of Charles Ketcham for rezoning from R-1 to C-1 and R-4 of a
portion of the NW¼ of the SE¼ of Section 29, T20S, R71E, MDB&M, generally described
as that property on the east side of Tonopah Highway lying between Washington
Avenue and Bonanza Road; and the application of the Carpenter's local #1780 for
rezoning from R-1 to C-1 and C-2 of a portion of the NW¼ of the SE¼ of Section 29,
T20S, R61E, MDB&M, generally described as that property on the west side of the
Tonopah Highway, lying between Washington Avenue and Bonanza Road, being
approximately five acres more or less, the matter was considered by the Board.

His Honor asked for a report from Commissioner Sharp on the meeting held with the
Planning Commission on June 4, 1954, concerning the policy to be followed on re-
zoning, variance and use permit applications.

Commissioner Sharp reported that it was the concensus of the Planning Commission
and members of the City Commission present at the aforementioned meeting not to
rezone any one of these areas, but to give the applicants a Use Permit for a
specific length of time so that the project can go ahead if the applicants
are acting in good faith. Commissioner Sharp further reported that a Use
Permit would expire if the proposed projects are not started within a certain
length of time and the property will then revert back to the original zoning.

He also stated that Use Permits allowed conditions to be imposed by the Commis-
sion which would be to the benefit of all concerned.

Thereafter His Honor asked if there were any objections to the granting of a Use
Permit to these two applicants.

Mr. Carol Heers representing the Twin Lakes Subdivision appeared before the
Board at this time and objected on the ground that in granting these Use Permits
for commercial use in this area, there would not be sufficient support for
two commercial zones. Mr. Heers was referring to a commercial zone previously
granted by the Board of Commissioners in his subdivision.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the applications of Charles Ketcham and the
Carpenter's Local #1780 for rezoning as above mentioned, be denied.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Jarrett and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Jarrett, Sharp and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Absent:	Commissioner Whipple.

Commissioner Sharp moved that Charles J. Ketcham and Carpenter's Local #1780 be
granted a Use Permit for the following described property:

(Formerly issued O. W. Glenn)	* New Locations

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes
none.

Discussion was held concerning the recent request of the YMCA for a location
for their proposed new building. Mr. Pedderson was present and the Commission
stated that the City-owned property known as Block 8, Biltmore Addition Annex
#3 would not be available. Mr. Pedderson was further informed that the City
had listed this particular property with the Real Estate Brokers in January,
1953, and up until the present time had not received an acceptable bid.

At this time an offer for the purchase of Block 8, Biltmore Addition, Annex #3
for $55,000.00 cash, was received. This proposal came from Dr. Alexander
Coblentz and a check in the amount of $5500.00 was placed on deposit.

Thereafter Commissioner Bunker moved this offer to purchase Block 8, Biltmore
Addition Annex #3 for $55,000.00 be accepted as this property has been listed
with the Real Estate Brokers since January, 1953; and it is the opinion of the
Commission that this offer is the only one received at a price acceptable
to them during this period of time.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Jarrett and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes,
none.

It was the concensus of the Board that the money realized from the sale of this
property be "earmarked" for recreational facilities on the Westside.

Thereafter the City Manager and City Engineer were instructed to submit a
plan for the proposed Westside recreational center.

At this time the Board considered the request of Judge Walter J. Richards
for payment of his salary from November 27, 1953 to and including June 7, 1954.

It was the opinion of the City Attorney that Judge Richards was not entitled to
payment of salary from November 27, 1953 to and including January 10, 1954,
as he requested leave of absence without pay, but was entitled to his salary
from January 11, 1954, to and including June 7, 1954, as he is an elected
officer and may recover salary for the term between lawful suspension and the
expiration of such suspension.

Thereafter Commissioner Sharp moved that Judge Richards be paid back salary
from January 11, 1954, to and including June 7, 1954, and the Mayor and Clerk
authorized to sign the warrant when prepared.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Jarrett and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes,
none.

At this time the City Engineer requested the authorization of a purchase order
to Win Ward Company in the amount of $5,048.05 for electrical equipment to be
mounted on the 1½ Ton Truck for the Electrical Department, Bid No. 54.18.

Thereafter Commissioner Bunker moved the City Engineer's request be approved.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Jarrett and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes
none.

At this time the City Manager discussed with the Commission the request of the
Fire Department for two additional cars to be used for the Fire Prevention
Bureau.

It was suggested by the Board that possibly bids on used cars could be secured.
It was further suggested that only one car be purchased at this time.

There being no further business to come before the Board at this time, the
meeting adjourned.

Las Vegas, Nevada
July 7, 1954

A regular meeting of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada,
held this 7th day of July, 1954, was called to order at the hour of 7:45 P.M.
by His Honor Mayor Baker with the following members present:

Mayor	C. D. Baker

Commissioner	Wendell Bunker

Commissioner	Rex A.	Jarrett

Commissioner	Harris	P.	Sharp

Commissioner	Reed Whipple

City Attorney	Howard	W.	Cannon

City Manager	George	H.	Rounthwaite

Asst. City Mgr	R. W. Notti

City Clerk	Shirley Ballinger

Commissioner Whipple moved that payroll warrants #69l6 thru $7375 in the net amount
of $58,278.41 be approved and the Mayor and Clerk authorized to sign same.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:

Commissioners Bunker, Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes,
none.

Commissioner Sharp moved that Service and Material Warrants #52451 to #52623 inclusive
in the total amount of $50,441.87 be approved and the Mayor and Clerk authorized to
sign same.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Commissioner Whipple moved that minutes of June 16, 21 and 28, 1954, be approved
by reference and the Mayor and Clerk authorized to sign same.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Jarrett and carried by the following vote:

Commissioners Bunker, Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple land His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

This being the time heretofore set for the continuation of the public hearing on the
application of Jack Wollenzien and Al Wendelboe for rezoning of their property
located at 3000 West Charleston Boulevard from R-E to C-1, the matter was
considered by the Board, and His Honor asked if there were any other objections
than those brought out on June 16, 1954.

Mr. Elwin Leavitt appeared before the Board at this time presenting several
petitions signed by property owners in this area who are protesting this rezoning.

Mr. Leavitt stated that this proposed rezoning was in the heart of a
residential area and would constitue a traffic hazard; further that there
were insufficient families in this area to make this venture successful.

Others who spoke in protest of this rezoning were as follows:	Mrs. Shegrue, Jack

Hassett, Jules Sarrett, Mr. Hammond, Mrs. A. W. Blackman, Judd Lilley, Robert and
Mrs. Iverson, Mrs. Weaver, George Franklin, sr., Mrs. Martha Klein, Fred Soly,

E. W. Cragin, Mr. Guffey, and Thomas Greenlaugh.

Jack Pursel, representing Jack Wollenzien and Al Wendelboe, appeared before the
Board at this time presenting an additional petition in favor of this rezoning.

Mr. Pursel stated that he felt this proposed shopping center would decrease rather
than increase the traffic on Charleston Boulevard as 90% of the traffic is caused
by residents of the West Charleston area going into town to do their shopping;
further that we have always had trouble with the traffic problem and one of the
best solutions is to take some of it out of the City. Mr. Pursel further stated
that instead of depreciating real estate values, he had been informed by real
estate brokers that such a shopping center in the community would bring the
property values up.

Others who spoke in favor of this rezoning application were as follows:	W. J. Carey,

Roy Killingsworth and Al Cahlan.

At this time the Mayor indicated it was the consensus of the Board of Commissioners
that this matter should be held for further advisement and deferred until July 9,

1954, at 7:30 P.M. at which time a decision will be made.

At the hour of 8:45 the meeting recessed. Meeting reconvened at the hour of
9:00 with all members present as of the opening session.

This being the time heretofore set for the continuation of the public hearing on the
application of Kenneth and Mildred Burr for a use permit to operate and maintain
a child nursery at 721 East Charleston, the matter was considered by the Board.

At this time Father Carmody, representing the Child Welfare Board, reported that
they approved these premises as a child nursery with some changes, specifically
limiting the number of children to 25 with no more than 10 in the yeard at one time;
however, their investigation of Mr. and Mrs. Burr is not complete at the present
time.

Thereafter Commissioner Whipple moved this application for a use permit be denied
and the following resolution adopted:

BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas in a regular
meeting held July 7, 1954, having considered the application of Kenneth and
Mildred Burr for a use permit to operate and maintain a child nursery at 721 East
Charleston; and

The Board having considered the decision of the Board of Adjustment denying this
application

of Charles Lee Horsey, Jr., for rezoning Lots 15 through 20, Block 21
Wardie Addition, generally located between 9th and 10th Streets, between
Gas and Garces Avenues from R-3 to C-1, the matter was considered by the Board.

At this time the Director of Public Works reported that he had talked with Mr. Tam,
President of the Judy Rich Enterprises, on the possibility of dedicating a 15 foot
alley between the Judy Rich Tract and Meadows Addition. Mr. Tam stated that he was
willing to give 8 feet if the adjacent property owners would give the remaining 7
feet; however, the other property owners didn't feel they could give the 7 feet at
this time, so they are to renegotiate.

At this time Mr. W. J. Norton appeared before the Board along with the Director of
Public Works and the Building Inspector to discuss the holdup on the construction
of Mr. Norton's building, at 823 North Main. It was explained to the Board that
there was very little likelihood that the right of way of Washington Boulevard in
this particular area could be utilized. The reason for this is that the UPRR may not
allow the City to go over the railroad tracks at this point and the cost of either
an underpass or overpass would be excessive insofar as the City is concerned.

Thereafter Commissioner Bunker moved that Mr. Norton be issued a new building permit
since the time limit on the original permit has expired, without any charge to
Mr. Norton.

not be driven outside the City limits.

Commissioner Jarrett stated that he felt that the property that Messrs. Wollenzien
and Wendelboe requested to be rezoned was not in the proper place because it was in
an R-E zone. He did not indicated that such a proposed shopping center would be
better situated in a closer populated area and that he would be in favor of the same
if such can be worked out.

Commissioner Sharp said that he seconded the motion to deny this application for
rezoning because it appeared from the petitions that were in favor of this proposed
shopping center, that approximately 90% of the people that lived in Hyde Park and
Westleigh Subdivisions; further that the count was practically ten to one against the
rezoning as indicated by the people signing the protest petition who live in
close proximity to this property. Commissioner Sharp stated that he would go along
with the Mayor's statement, if that was what the people wanted.

This being the continuation of the public hearing on the application of Thomas E.

Kirby to construct and maintain an office and rental unit on the following described
property:

Lot 4, Block 17, 14th Street City Addition, known as 430 North 15th St.

said variance having been denied by the Board of Adjustment, and said denial
appealed by Mr. Kirby, the matter was considered by the Board of Commissioners
at this time.

The City Attorney advised the Board that a time limit could be imposed on variance
applications.

Thereafter Commissioner Jarrett moved the application of Thomas E. Kirby to maintain
an office and rental unit on Lot 4, Block 17, 14th Street City Addition, known as
430 North 15th Street be approved and a limitation be placed on this property of one
year for such use provided also that Mr. Kirby retain ownership of this property;

Mr. Coulthard stated that his client had secured permission to use the parking lot of
Terrible Herbst, said property being approximately a block away from Mr. Lasky's
proposed building. Mr. Coulthard further stated that in the event this lease should
not go through for some reason or other, that Mr. Hawthorne of the Hawthorne House had
indicated that he would be agreeable to leasing space to Mr. Lasky for parking facilities
for his tenants.

Mr. Thomas Foley representing Mr. Theodore Glenn owner of the Glenn Vegas Motel and Mr.

Commission to go over the set-up as to the Architect's responsibility in the alterations to
City Hall, and what the situation is in the remodeling. He stated that the City has run
into things that there does not seem to be an answer for, and the Board would like to
discuss it.

Mr. Whipple indicated that it was the understanding of the Commission that there had been a
lack of supervision on the job since the commencement and would like to hear the Architect,

Mr. Welborn's side of the story: if he	had neglected it and if so,	why.

Mr. Vernon Welborn was present at this	time and stated that he did	not feel	he	had	neglected

the job. He further outlined briefly why he did not feel he had been derelict in his
duties by pointing out that under his original contract he had been	requested to furnish

plans for a single floor which he did.	Later it was found that it	would be	to	the	best

advantage of the City, and within the money allotted, to have two floors instead of the
original plan with steel partitions. Thereafter new plans were made and submitted. Mr.

Welborn further stated that he had been on the job several times as had his assistant
Mr. Julio Lucasia and engineers he had hired to assist him had been here on three
occasions.

Absent:	Mayor Baker.

Commissioner Jarrett moved that the present Youth Center known as the City Recreation Center,

property located between Harrison Street and the North City limits, west of H Street
extended and east of the extension of J Street extended, the matter was considered by
the Board.

His Honor asked if there were any objections to the granting of this rezoning. There
were no protests voiced.

Commissioner Whipple asked the applicants if they had any objection to the Commission
granting a Use Permit instead of rezoning this property.

Mr. McDonald, speaking for the applicants stated that the only drawback would be
in the possible inability of the developers of this proposed project securing
the required financing. Mr. McDonald asked if a Use Permit was revocable.

City Attorney Howard W. Cannon answered that a Use Permit was not revocable
unless the developer used the property for another purpose than for which the
permit is granted.

Thereafter Commissioner Sharp moved that the application of E. L. Josephson and
V. D. Eachus to reclassify this property be held in abeyance and a Use Permit
granted to the applicants to use the property in accordance with their proposed
general plans; said Use Permit to expire at the end of six months unless
construction shall be commenced by then.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Jarrett and carried by the following vote:

Commissioners Bunker, Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Baker voting
aye; noes, none.

This being the time heretofore set for the public hearing on the application of
Rancho Drive Realty to rezone Block 3, El Centro Addition, Tract No. 2 from
R-2, R-3 and R-4 to C-d, the matter was considered by the Board.

His Honor asked if there were any objections to the granting of this rezoning.

proposed rezoning would devaluate surrounding property, increase traffic and would
prefer the area to remain as residential zoning:

E. W. Brierley	1921 Santa Paula

Mrs. Fanny Goodman	1917 and 1925 Santa Paula

Mr. R. J. Kaltenborn, representing the Rancho Drive Realty appeared and requested the
approval of the Commission on this application. Mr. Kaltenborn presented the plans

fairness to the people in this area.

This motion died for lack of a second.

Thereafter Commissioner Whipple moved a Use Permit be granted if the proper plans and
specifications are approved by the Building Department and if they are in accordance
with said general plans.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Jarrett stated that he voted against the motion because he felt all the people had
not been properly advised of the situation. Commissioner Sharp disqualified himself

This being the time heretofore set for the public hearing on the application of the
proposed change of zone on the location of Tavern Liquor licenses, generally described
as being the zone on Main Street from Charleston Boulevard southerly to the inter-
section of South Main and South 5th Streets, the matter was considered by the Board.

The Mayor asked if there was any discussion from the floor. Lt. Hall representing
the Salvation Army located at 10 Stewart Street protested this proposed rezoning
on the grounds that they did not want a tavern serving liquor adjacent to the church.

Commissioner Sharp then moved that this proposed change of zone for Tavern Liquor licenses
be denied.

Commissioner Whipple seconded the motion.

Before the vote was taken, Mr. Drexel Denton asked the Commission the reason for this
motion of denial due to the fact that this was a commercial zone and there were
petitions in favor of said rezoning.

Commissioner Whipple stated that there were two reasons for this denial. First, it
would create a greater policing problem, and, second, that he knew of a number of
people that objected to this rezoning and the Committee felt there was ample zone for
tavern locations in Las Vegas.

Commissioner Jarrett then asked if there were any objections to this rezoning from the
floor.

Mr. Herb Jones stated that he felt the town should keep up with the growth in population,
but was not a strenuous objector.

The vote was then taken on the motion that this proposed change of zone be denied.
Commissioners Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, Commissioner Jarrett.

Absent:	Commissioner Bunker. Motion carried by the foregoing vote:	Commissioner

Jarrett stated that there were too many liquor places at the present time.

This being the time heretofore set for a public hearing on the proposed ordinance on
height regulation with Nellis Air Force Base; the title of which is as follows:	AN

ORDINANCE REGULATING THE HEIGHT OF STRUCTURES AND OBJECTS OF NATURAL GROWTH, AND OTHERWISE
REGULATING THE USE OF PROPERTY WITHIN THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS, NEAR THE VICINITY OF NELLIS
AIR FORCE BASE, CLARK COUNTY, NEVADA, BY CREATING HEIGHT LIMITING ZONES AND ESTABLISHING THE

This being the time heretofore set for a report from Commissioners Jarrett and Whipple on the
proposed resumption of license fee for the Southern Nevada Disposal Company, the committee
asked that this matter be held in abeyance until the next regular meeting.

This being the time heretofore set for the award of the bid on the Moveable Bleachers for
the City Recreation Center, the Director of Public Works recommended that the bid of the
Wayne Iron Works in the amount of $20,518.00 be approved.

Mr. Wade stated that the bid of Marston Supply Company was lower; however, their bleachers
are 4'2" wide while Wayne Iron Works are 2'll" and as the City is limited for space, he
feels that the bid of Wayne Iron Works would be more advantageous to the City.

The Commission discussed the matter of funds for this project, and it was decided to defer
this matter for the time being.

This being the time heretofore set to award the Bid on the Water Softener for the Police
Department, this matter was deferred until later in the year as A. H. Kennedy's budget will
not take this expenditure at the present time.

Mr. George Wade at this time stated that this bid would have to be deferred as it was
found after checking the plans that it will he necessary to move the pumping plant
approximately 400 feet from the spot picked by the Commission. This will cost
approximately $1500.00 to grade with a saving of $750.00 on the other end of the line.
However, the bidders will proceed with the work at the unt price they submitted.

Mr. Wade stated that this award of bid must also be deferred as it is in connection with
Schedule D Sewer.

It was decided that a meeting will be held either September 27 or 28 at 4 or 4:30 P.M.

Commissioner Sharp requested that Mr. Cairns from Wells Cargo speak on the proposed
ordinance.

Mr. Cairns stated that Wells Cargo is very much in favor of this ordinance if all
contractors will abide by the regulations. He also mentioned that his company
would be glad to help enforce same if it is passed.

Commissioner Sharp then reported that he will have a further report for the next
meeting.

City Clerk, Shirley Ballinger; then requested the Board's decision on proper
notification to the public concerning hearings on variances; use permits; and
rezoning.

It was the decision of the Board that the public in the area should be notified by
mail by the City Clerk if notification not already sent to the public by the
Planning Commission.

Mr. Herb Jones appeared before the Board at this time with a petition that
South 3rd between Oakey and South 5th Streets and Wyoming between South 5th and
3rd Streets be closed. Mr. Jones stated that the Police Department had set up a
stop sign and the auto courts in this area are being forced out of business as
traffic is unable to enter this area.

The Board pointed out that this matter had been before the Commission in previous
meetings and the property owners had decided to have this top-sign placed in
this area.

Mayor Baker stated that this matter should be brought before the Traffic and
Parking Commission as well as the Planning Commission before it comes before
the Board of Commissioners.

Therefore this matter is held in abeyance until such time as the Traffic and
Parking Commission as well as the Planning Commission report on this district.

Mr. Laub and Mr. William Coulthard were present at this time representing the
Nevada Southern Gas Company to request deletion or amendment to the portion of
the Gas Frachise requiring isolation of a four-block area. Mr. Laub also
requested that the City adopt the American Standard Association Manuel as a
code.

Thereafter Commissioner Whipple moved the franchise with the Nevada Southern Gas
Company be amended to delete the isolation area requirement and a provision that iso-
lation districts mutually agreed upon by the City and the Gas Company substituted
in said agreement; further that the Mayor and Clerk be authorized to sign this
amendment when the same has been prepared.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:

Commissioners Jarrett; Sharp; Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Absent:	Commissioner Bunker.

The City Clerk then read the Resolution on the new Tax Rate.

Commissioner Jarrett moved this resolution be adopted subject to the addition of
the amount of underestimate in the assessed valuation be included in this
resolution:

RESOLUTION

WHEREAS; the Mayor and Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas has submitted
a proposed budget for the coming fiscal year based on a certain total valuation of
property with the City of Las Vegas; and

WHEREAS; under the said proposed budget the City was to receive revenue based on a
tax rate of 96 cents per $100.00 assessed valuation of property within the City; and

WHEREAS; it now appears that the total valuation upon which taxes will be levied if
$7,883,925.00 less than the estimated valuation upon which the 96 cent rate was to
be levied;

WHEREAS; in order to receive sufficient revenue to properly operate; it is
necessary that the tax rate be increased throughout the County and correspondingly
for the City of Las Vegas; and

WHEREAS; The proposed increase in the tax rate for the City of Las Vegas will result
in a rate of $1.05 of the total tax rate of $4.23 to be levied; and

WHEREAS; the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas feels that the
increase to $1.05 is necessary for said City, and in the public interest;

NOW; THEREFORE; BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las
Vegas that the tax rate for the forthcoming year (fiscal) should be $1.05 per
$100.00 valuation of property within the City of Las Vegas based upon a total tax

 At this time a petition was presented for extension of Washington Avenue from North Main

Commissioner Whipple moved that this matter be referred to the Parking and Traffic
Commission and the petition ordered filed.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Jarrett and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent:	Commissioner

Bunker.

Commissioner Whipple moved that Service and Material Warrants No. 51221, 51224 to
51226 inclusive and Nos. 53199 to 53338 inclusive in the total amount of $133,123.47
be approved and the Mayor and Clerk authorized to sign same.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none:	Absent:	Commissioner

Bunker.

Mr. John Mendoza came before the Board at this time with the request that the Plumbing
Ordinance be amended so that Specialty Licenses for the installation of sprinkler systems
would be allowed. Mr. Mendoza's purpose in coming before the Board was to bring this
matter to light so that an investigation could be made.

It was pointed out that many cities have such an amendment and Mr. Sharp requested the
City to secure some of these ordinances so that same may be looked over.

Mr. Rounthwaite and Mr. Mendoza stated that there has been no definite decision by Mrs.
Santa Cruz as yet as to the purchase of this lot.

City Manager Rounthwaite stated that the recommendation on the Playground Equipment bids is
not ready and requested this be held in abeyance until the next meeting as there is
more analyzation to be done.

Mr. Rounthwaite requested permission to hire a welder on a full time basis. This matter
has been approved by the Civil Service Trustees. Said welder would work in the City
Garage and be classified under Sch. 21 of the Pay Plan.

Commissioner Sharp moved that this be approved.

Seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners Jarrett,

Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent:	Commissioner Bunker.

Mr. Wade presented a rough draft of a chit concerning the football equipment which will
be provided for the Recreation Department. Said Agreement must be signed by the parents
of the boys receiving the football equipment in which it is stated that the parents will
be responsible for returning the equipment in good condition, with allowances for
normal wear and tear.

At this time City Engineer George Wade presented the bids on the paving of Rancho Road
and Charleston Boulevard. Mr. Wade recommended that the bid be awarded to Wells
Cargo at 65 cents a foot.

It was pointed out that Ideal Asphalt presented a bid at 54 cents; however, the City would
have to roll and chip at an additional cost to the City of 25 cents a foot, making a
total of 79 cents a foot. Therefore the bid of Ideal Asphalt would actually cost the
City 14 cents a foot more than the flat bid of Wells Cargo at 65 cents a foot.

There is approximately 6000 square yards to be paved.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the City Engineer's recommendation be approved.

Commissioner Whipple suggested that the figures of both bids be shown in the records so
that the bid of Wells Cargo can be shown as the actual low bid.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent:	Commissioner

Bunker.

Mr. Rounthwaite presented a request at this time that the City provide the three trainee
draftsmen in the Engineering Department with entrance fee to the Nevada Southern College
where a draftsmen course is being given at night. The City does not provide adequate
training to these people, and the City would benefit greatly from this course.

The tuition would be $20.00 per person. The course is given two evenings a week.

Commissioner Whipple stated that he felt a precedent would be started if the City paid for
this schooling, and Commissioner Sharp agreed.

Commissioner Jarrett moved that the request of the City Manager and the City
Engineer for permission to send three trainee draftsmen to night school at a
total cost of $60.00 be denied.

This motion died for lack of a second.

At this time the request of Mrs. Spaugh to buy land from the City in East Charleston was
considered.

Commissioner Sharp moved this request be denied.

Commissioner Jarrett seconded the motion which was carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent:

At this time the request of Mr. Maxwell to attend the Cemetery Alliance

Commissioner Sharp stated that precedent had already been established and he
felt this request must be granted.

Commissioner Jarrett moved that this request be denied.

Commissioner Sharp moved that this request be approved.

Both motions died for lack of a second.

City Manager George Rounthwaite wished the Board to know that the Rancho
High School and Board of Education had decided to build one well for the
Rancho High School with auxiliary pump. They feel that only one well is
necessary at the present time which will keep the expense down.

The question was raised at this time as to whether the City should publish
the lifting of the water ban.

However, the Board felt that the original resolution stressed the date of the
end of the ban sufficiently.

Mayor Baker stated he felt the public should be congratulated on their
cooperation.

Asst. City Manager R. W. Notti reported on the Municipal Court records at this
time. Mr. Notti stated that Conway, Moe, Hibbs and Funston had been working at
the court and there are two new employees to keep the current records up to date
and one new employee who is working on the old records. The records of the Municipal
Court should be up to date within a month, and the daily cash reports are now
coming in on schedule.

The Board of Commissioners at this time publicly thanked Mr. Collins and Mr. Trent
for the job they did with the swimming pool. Revenue this year is $2624 over 1953.

Discussion was held on the possibility of acquiring a portion of the Union Pacific
Railroad Property known as the Old Rancho, by submitting a joint proposal to the
Railroad along with the LDS Church and the Elks Club.

Commissioner Jarrett moved the Mayor be authorized to sign a letter with the LDS
Church and the Elks Club notifying the UPRR that we will present a formal proposal
of the purchase of the Old Ranch property within thirty days.

Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Baker, voting aye; noes, none.

percent of the parking meter money be set aside for off-street parking purposes and

ordinance be amended to allow the use of this money for off-street parking purposes.

Discussion followed. Mr. Herb McDonald of the Chamber of Commerce asked if it was
true that $100,000 had been set aside by the City for parking purposes. Mayor
Baker answered that this amount had been earmarked from the sale of the City's
strip property, but had not been used due to the fact that there had been no land
available at this price.

Commissioner Sharp suggested the possibility of selling Revenue Bonds to secure
enough money to install off-street parking lots. Mr. Franklin Bills, Planning
Director, outlined the bad points to securing money through Revenue Bonds.

There being no further business to come before the Board, the meeting adjourned.

City Manager Rounthwaite stated that General Parking, Inc., represented by Mr. Fredricks
would like to take over the City's leases on the 3rd and Ogden parking lot and the 4th
and Ogden parking lot. They would be willing to pay the City $250 a month plus taking
over the leases for these lots. Eventually they plan to place a multiple parking building
on the 3rd and Ogden lot and use the 4th and Ogden for overflow. Consent will have to
be obtained from the owners of the 3rd and Ogden lot, but no permission is necessary
from the owners of the 4th and Ogden lot.

Discussion was held among the Board members and City Attorney Howard Cannon stated there
were several matters that should be settled before anything is done on this proposal.

Mr. Cannon believes that, one the City should find out if additional parking will
definitely be provided, two, the fees General Parking, Inc., will impose, and, three,
a definite date should be set for building of the multiple parking lot.

Commissioner Bunker then moved that this matter be referred to the Parking and
Traffic Commission.

subdivider pays the assessments.

At this time discussion was held among the Board members over the City Ordinance

Commissioner Jarrett requested additional time before reporting on the proposed
amendment to the Parking Meter Ordinance.

Mr. Herb McDonald of the Chamber of Commerce was present at this time to request
the City to participate financially in a special census for 1955. Mr. McDonald
stated that it would cost approximately $7,000.00 and requested that The City
put up $2,63O.OO. This matter was held over until the regular meeting on October
20, 1954.

City Manager George Rounthwaite reported on the sewer agreement for the Las
Vegas Turf Club and stated that Mr. Fred Johnston had agreed to pay $300.00 for
this month. It was decided to negotiate with the McNeill Construction Company
for an agreement since they are the prime lessees on the race track.

Mr. Rounthwaite requested the wish of the Commission on political banners across
the streets. It was decided that each of the political parties would be allowed
one banner, and that they should furnish sufficient evidence of insurance.

Commissioner Jarrett was opposed to this and made a motion that no political banners
be placed across the streets. This motion died for lack of a second.

City Engineer George Wade reported that Floor Covering for the lower floor of the
new addition could be secured for approximately $4,000.00. Mr. Wade was requested
to secure bids.

Mr. Rounthwaite presented the proposal of Sarratt's Office Equipment for the

adjourned.

This being the time heretofore set for continuation of the Public Hearing on the protest
of the granting of a Use Permit to Rancho Drive Realty for the installation of a
shopping center on Block 3, El Centro Tract No. 2, the Mayor asked if there was any
additional information.

Mr. Coulthard, representing Rancho Drive Realty, requested the Commission to rescind
their action of granting a Use Permit so that a new application may be entered for a
zone change on this property to R-4.

Mr. Cleveland Schultz, a protestant, asked the Commission if the Use Permit was
rescinded would a zone change follow automatically. The Commission stated that this
new application would go through the proper channels and the application for a zone
change would eventually come before the Board for their decision.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Jarrett, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent: Commissioner Sharp.

Commissioner Bunker made an additional motion that this matter be referred to the Planning
Commission for their consideration and recommendation on the application for rezoning to
R-4 and that the Planning Commission should hold a Public Hearing on this matter.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Jarrett and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Jarrett, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent: Commissioner Sharp.

Commissioner Jarrett stated that he felt the Planning Commission should consider this
application very carefully and decide whether R-2, R-3, or R-4 zoning would be more
beneficial to this area; however, Commissioner Jarrett stood by the original motion.

This being the time heretofore set to continue the Public Hearing on the rezoning from
R-3 to C-2 of the property of H. F. Ahmanson, SE¼ SE¼ SE¼ of Section 35, the Mayor asked
if there were any new developments.

Franklin Bills, Planning Director, stated that while there were no official changes, there
was an unofficial change in the status of this matter. A letter has been received from
the State Highway Commission, Traffic Division, stating that they will hold a meeting with
the Traffic and Planning Commission and a plan of their engineering for this intersection
will be submitted to the City.

Commissioner Bunker moved that this Public Hearing be continued until the next meeting.

Commissioner Whipple seconded the motion which was carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Jarrett, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent:
Commissioner Sharp.

At this time Mr. Claiborne, Mr. Jack Gilson and Mr. Leo Gilson appeared before the Board.

Mayor Baker stated that they had been called before the Board because of a police report
on their establishment in which the following matters were brought to light:	One, the

sale of liquor to people already under the influence; two, the serving of liquor by
bartenders drinking to excess themselves; three, woman employees drinking with customers;
four, uncooperative attitude toward the Police Department.

Mr. Claiborne, representing Mr. Gilson, stated there was no animosity toward the Police
Department; however, Mr. Gilson had felt at one time that his establishment was being
singled out by the Police. Later Mr. Gilson learned that all places in this area were
receiving the same treatment as it was just a general enforcement operation of the Police
Department.

Mr. Jack Gilson speaking as the owner of the Swinging Door Saloon stated that he did not
allow bartenders to drink while working and that he had fired several in the past for this
offense. He also stated that he had been away at the time the Police Department reported
a waitress drinking with a customer. However, his brother informed him that this was a
new girl who was not aware of the policies of the Swinging Door.

Commissioner Jarrett then asked if there was a City Ordinance forbidding employees to
drink while working.

Chief Kennedy stated that there was such an ordinance which stated that owners and
employees could not work in an establishment while drinking; however, it was the policy
of the Police Department not to enforce this unless a person was drinking to excess.

Mayor Baker stated that similar cases had been brought before the Commission in the past
and that upon a second offense, it was the policy of the Commission to rescind liquor
licenses, and that he sincerely hoped this matter would never come before the Board again.

The report on the Southern Nevada Disposal Company was continued until a later meeting.

At this time the Board considered the appeal by W. R. Husband of the denial of his
application for a Use Permit to store tile at 2222 West Bonanza Road.

Commissioner Jarrett moved that a Public Hearing be set for November 17, 1954.

Commissioner Whipple seconded the motion which was carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Jarrett, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Baker voting aye; noes, none.

At this time the Board considered the petition for annexation of S½ of Section 35,

T20S, R60E by C. L. Whitchurch. The Board stated that a survey of the sewers must be
taken to see if this subdivision can be served before any action is taken by the Board.

At this time the Board considered the application of W. S Robinson for a Variance to
build a carport at 525 Park Paseo; this matter was continued from the October 6th meeting.

The Building Department had been requested to submit the building permit for this carport;
however, the plans have as yet not been found. The Building Department stated that the
contractor had not been licensed at the time the permit was issued.

Mr. Thomas Foley representing Mr. Robinson stated that as a permit had been issued and
the contractor licensed, he did not believe the Board should decide that this carport
should be removed even though it was against City Ordinances.

Planning Director Franklin Bills stated that the Board of Adjustment's recommendation

was that this variance be denied due to the fact that if any building was allowed to exist

which was not in accordance with the City Ordinance, said ordinance would soon be worthless.

Commissioner Jarrett moved that this variance be denied in accordance with the recommendation
of the Board of Adjustment.

Discussion followed among the Board members in which it was stated that the carport's
roof overhangs on City property one foot.

Mr. Foley requested that before the Commission makes a decision on this matter that

Commissioner Bunker moved that this matter be continued to give the Building
Department more time to find said plans.

Commissioner Whipple seconded the motion which was carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Jarrett, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Absent:	Commissioner Sharp.

Commissioner Whipple moved that the tentative map of Edgeview Manor subdivision
be approved as recommended by the Planning Commission.

Commissioner Bunker seconded the motion which was carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Jarrett, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Absent: Commissioner Sharp.

At this time the application of Judy Rich Enterprises for the reclassification of
land adjacent to San Francisco Street and Tam Tract from M-1 and R-4 to C-2 was
considered.

The Planning Commission requested that this matter be deferred until the next
meeting so that a legal description of this property may be furnished.

The Planning Commission requested approval in general principle of the proposal of
Desert Sales Corporation for the dedication on an 80 foot highway (approximately
500 feet in length) running south from Charleston Boulevard, together with the
request for the reclassification of property east of the proposed street dedication
from R-4 to M-1, and request for a variance on a portion of R-4 land adjacent to
the proposed street.

The Board after much discussion agreed with the principle of this proposal as
presented this evening; however, there was no action taken.

Commissioner Whipple moved that the tentative map of the Glenn Heather Subdivision
be approved subject to clearance from the School District concerning a school site.

Seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; Commissioner Jarrett did not vote as he
has a financial interest in this property.

The Board considered the appeal of M. S McCoy of the denial of his application
for a Use Permit to construct a service station at the intersection of Charleston
Boulevard and Rancho Road.

Commissioner Jarrett moved that a Public Hearing be set for November 17, 1954.

Commissioner Whipple seconded the motion which was carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Jarrett, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Absent:	Commissioner Sharp.

At this time Mrs. T. H. Steele appeared before the Board requesting a variance
for off-street parking at 209 East Charleston. Mrs. Steele stated that she was
having trouble renting these offices due to the fact that parking was a problem.

The Board stated that as this was a State Highway, the Board could really take
no action.

At this time Howard Cannon, City Attorney, requested that the Board approve the
request of the party who damaged the City's motorcycle to pay for this over a
period of time. Said person has no insurance.

Commissioner Bunker moved that this recommendation be approved.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Jarrett, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Absent:	Commissioner Sharp.

Commissioner Jarrett moved that the application of Lewis Whitney for a Detective
Agency License, dba Merchant Patrol, Inc., 900 South 5th Street, be approved.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Jarrett, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Absent:	Commissioner Sharp.

At this time Commissioner Sharp arrived at the meeting.

At 9:30 P.M. the meeting adjourned.

The meeting reconvened at 9:45 P.M. with all members present.

Mr. Joe Foley representing Mr. Joseph Mankiewitz appeared before the Board at
this time requesting renewal of the beer license and restaurant beverage license
for the Westside Tavern.

The Building and Fire Departments recommend this building be condemned and that
it either be demolished or moved.

Mr. Foley asked that the Board reinstate the above licenses for a reasonable
time and in the meantime Mr. Mankiewitz will either bring this building up to
code or find another place.

The Building Department has not as yet condemned this building, but stated it
is a fire hazard and in a very dangerous area.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the Westside Tavern he given 90 days to comply with the

Commissioner Bunker seconded the motion which was carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Mr Bert O'Donnell representing the Chamber of Commerce requested that the City
of Las Vegas help with the payment of a census to be taken next year. The cost to
the City would be approximately $2,630 00 which would be paid to the United States
Government. The Chamber of Commerce would raise the additional $4,500.00 to pay for
the cost of hiring local people to take this census.

The Chamber of Commerce feels that this is very necessary as in the 1950 census,

Las Vegas was credited with only 26,000 people and today it is known there are approx-
imately 50,000. Many large companies will not finance this area because of belief it
is a small town. The City will benefit greatly from the official recognition of
Las Vegas being a large city.

City Attorney Cannon stated that if this money is allocated and sent to the United
States Government, there is no return even if the Chamber of Commerce is unable to
raise the additional funds.

Commissioner Bunker moved that the City Attorney be authorized to draw up the appropriate
resolution authorizing the expenditure of funds.

Commissioner Sharp seconded the motion which was carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Commissioner Sharp stated that this census would only cover the City.

Director of Public Works George Wade requested permission to issue a Purchase Order
in the amount of $600.00 payable to Tyson Engineering for the design and stakeout of
extension of Atlantic Avenue from St. Louis to San Francisco.

Commissioner Sharp moved that this expenditure be approved.

Seconded by Commissioner Jarrett and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Mr. Wade recommended the final acceptance and release of bond subject to two conditions;
one, an additional bond to insure the hooking up of the street lights (Tract No. 1 and
No. 2 are now on one line, and the lights in No. 1 cannot be put on until Tract No. 2
is finished) two, submission of the As-Built drawings which are now 95 per cent complete.

Commissioner Whipple moved the final acceptance and release of bond be approved subject
to the condition of a bond in the amount of $5,000 being submitted to insure the hooking
up of the street lights.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Jarrett and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Mr. Wade requested permission to advertise for bids for basketball backstops and goals
for the Recreation Center at a probable cost of $1,600.

Commissioner Whipple moved that permission be granted to advertise for bids providing
funds are definitely available.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Jarrett and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

At this time the Board considered the acceptance of a right of way deed for street
purposes in Maryland Parkway, 100-23, executed by Romy Hammes, Inc.

On Motion of Commissioner Whipple duly seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by
unanimous vote, the following resolution is adopted and order made:

City of Las Vegas, County of Clark, State of Nevada, that the deed, dated the 2nd day

No. 100-25. Mr. Cannon stated that when he talked with the State officials last week they
assured him they would be ready to accept bids before the first of the year; however, he
had contacted them yesterday and they find that they will not be able to ask for bids until
January 6, 1955. They suggested that the City request until January 20, 1955 for the
delivery of the bonds. Mr. Cannon said that he had called Mr. Manente concerning the ex-
tension of time, and Mr. Manente stated that he would let him know in a day or so.

City is delaying this improvement, and that is absolutely not correct; as of Thursday of
last week they had informed him that they would not have their plans ready by Monday.

to secure bids by the first of November. They then set it up until the first of December,
and now are delaying it until January 6th.

WHEREAS, Street Improvement Assessment District No. 100-25 was created by
Emergency Ordinance No. 601, and

WHEREAS, the cost and expense of making said improvements have been
radically reduced due to a saving obtained by the construction of said improvements
jointly with a highway widening program of the State Highway Department of the State

WHEREAS, a new public hearing must be held upon the amended assessment roll
for Street Improvement District No. 100-25.

NOW, THEREFORE, the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas does

The entire cost and expense of making said improvements are deemed to be $104,161.07
and the total of the special assessments so levied shall be in that amount.

prepare, and is hereby empowered, authorized and directed to make forthwith, an

Vegas, Nevada, and shall assess each lot and parcel of land with such relative
portion of the whole amount to be levied as the length of front of such premises
abutting upon the improvement bears to the whole frontage of all the lots to be
assessed; unless on account of the shape or size of any lot or lots an assessment
for a different number of feet would be more equitable; and the frontage of all
lots to be assessed shall be deemed to be the aggregate number of feet as
determined upon for assessment by the assessor.

SECTION 3. Section 8 of Ordinance No. 601 is hereby amended to read
as follows:	That before said amended special assessment roll is adopted and

confirmed by said Board, any person objecting to the assessment may file his

said amended special assessment roll is confirmed and approved, without interest
and without demand; provided, that all such assessments, or any part thereof, may,
at the election of the owner, be paid in installments with interest, as hereinafter
provided. Failure to pay the whole assessment, or any part thereof, within said

ten substantially equal annual installments of principal, the first of which
installments of principal shall be due and payable on or before the 1st day of
March, 1956, and the remainder of said installments shall be due and payable
successively on or before the same day in each year thereafter until paid in full,
with interest in all cases on the unpaid and deferred installments of principal
from the 1st day of March, 1955, at the same rate of interest as that provided for
in the special assessment bond to be hereafter authorized, sold, issued and
delivered, but not to exceed seven per centum (7%) per annum, payable annually
at the office of said Ex-officio City Treasurer, the first annual payment of
interest being due and payable on the 1st day of March, 1956, and the remainder of
said annual installments of interest being due and payable on the 1st day of March
in each year thereafter. Failure to pay any installment, whether of principal or
interest, when due, shall cause the whole of the unpaid principal to become due and
payable immediately, and the whole amount of the unpaid principal and accrued
interest shall thereafter bear penalty at the rate of ten per centum (10%) per
annum, until the day of sale, but at any time prior to the day of the sale, the
owner may pay the amount of all unpaid installments, with interest thereon at ten
per centum (10%) per annum, and all penalties accrued, and shall thereupon be
restored to the right thereafter to pay in installments in the same manner as if
default had not been suffered. The owner of any property not in default as to any
installment or payment, may, at any time, pay the whole of the unpaid principal with
interest accruing thereon to the next interest paying date.

tax roll of Clark County on and against the several owners and premises, and the

Vegas, is hereby authorized and directed to enter the same on the tax roll of said
County and to extend the same in a special column for special assessments on said
tax roll, and the County Treasurer of said County, the Ex-officio City Treasurer and

judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remaining provisions of this

and the inapplicability and invalidity of any section, sentence, clause or part of
this ordinance, in any one or more instances shall not affect or prejudice in any
way the applicability and validity of this ordinance in any other instances.

SECTION 8. That by reason of the fact that the streets of the City of
Las Vegas are inadequate to meet the present and future needs of the City and its
inhabitants and that it is necessary immediately to raise funds to improve said
streets, therefore, it is hereby declared that an emergency exists, and that this
ordinance is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health

2-21-55

At this time the Board considered the application of Drs. J. H. Swartzfager, K. F. Smith,

G.	W. Tueller and Ralph Reed for a Use Permit to erect a one-story building to be used for
medical offices on the west side of Rancho Road between Charleston Blvd. and Palomino
Lane. The public hearing on this application was held by the Board of Commissioners on
March 21, 1955 and taken under advisement at that time.

Mrs. Cornelius Hurley appeared before the Board protesting the granting of this use permit
for medical offices in a residential area.

There was also placed on file the written protest of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Teel, 2231 W.
Charleston Blvd., requesting that this permit be denied for the same reasons set forth by
Mrs. Hurley.

Mr. Bruce Beckley appeared on behalf of Drs. Swartzfager, Smith, Tueller and Reed and
requested that this permit be approved.

Thereafter Commissioner Sharp moved that this use permit be approved as recommended by
the Board of Adjustment on the legal description submitted, said description to be made a
part of the record, due to the fact that the Commission has determined that this proposed
construction is in the best interest of the public and further since only two protests were
filed by property owners in the vicinity:

That parcel of land lying in the SE¼ SE¼ Section 32, Township 20 South,

Range 61 East, M. D. B. & M. more particularly described as follows:

COMMENCING at the southeast corner of said Section 32, thence North 89˚

33' 30" West a distance of 664.8 feet along the center line of
Charleston Boulevard to a point, thence North 0°16' 30" West a distance
of 330.0 feet to the true point of beginning; thence North 89˚33' 30"

West	a distance	of	661.90	feet	to	a point;	thence North 0˚16' 30"

East	a distance	of	466.36	feet	to	a point;	thence South 89° 33' 30"

East	a distance	of	613.72	feet	to	a point on the westerly right of	way

line	of Rancho Road (150 ft. wide), thence	southeasterly along the	said

westerly right of way line on a curve having a central angle of 3°42'

29" and a radius of 1543.0 feet, an arc length distance of 100.0 feet
to a point; thence south 0° 16' 30" West a distance of 378.6 feet to the
true point of beginning.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

At the hour of 8:00 P.M. the meeting recessed. The meeting reconvened at the hour of
8:25 P.M. with all members present as of the opening session.

The Board considered the proposed agreement for the furnishing of sewer service submitted
by the Strip Hotels, namely Sahara, Thunderbird, Algiers, El Rancho and Riviera.

Thereafter Commissioner Bunker moved that for and in consideration of $100,000.00 sewer
rental fees advance by the Strip Hotels the Sahara, Thunderbird, Algiers, El Rancho
and Riviera at the rate of $30,000.00 per year, which is approximately 50% more than
changed similar enterprises in the City of Las Vegas, the City agrees to furnish sewage
treatment until June 1, 1958; forfeiture of said balance to be to the City if said Hotels
convert to County Sewer and may be terminated in six months' notice after January 1,

1957; that the agreement submitted be approved and the Mayor and Clerk authorized to

Las Vegas, Nevada
May 25, 1955

A special meeting of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada held
this 25th day of May, 1955 was called to order at the hour of 7:30 P.M. by His Honor
Mayor Baker with the following members present:

Mayor	C. D. Baker

Commissioner	Wendell Bunker

Commissioner	Harris P. Sharp

Commissioner	Rex A. Jarrett

Commissioner	Reed Whipple

City Manager	George	H.	Rounthwaite

Assistant City Manager	Robert	W.	Notti

City Attorney	Howard	W.	Cannon

City Engineer	George	E.	Wade

Planning Director	Franklin Bills

City Clerk	Shirley Ballinger

This being the time set for the public hearing on the appeal on the application of the
Jewish Community Center of Las Vegas, Inc. for a Use Permit to construct and maintain a
Synagogue, Assembly Hall and Sunday School classrooms on a five acre parcel located
adjacent to South 15th and Bracken Streets, as approved by the Board of Adjustment, His
Honor asked that the attorney for the applicant present the reasons for requesting this
permit.

Thereafter Mr. David Zenoff, representing the Jewish Community Center Board of Directors
appeared before the Board. Mr. Zenoff stated that it was his understanding that the
protestants to the granting of this permit were objecting mainly to the installation of
the classes for pre-kindergarten children on the following basis:

1)	That this operation would depreciate the value of surrounding property.

Mr. Zenoff reported that he had statistics that would disprove this
fact, and that this installation would improve rather than devaluate
the surrounding property.

2)	That this installation would create a traffic hazard, or at least an
increase in the amount of traffic in the area, due to the fact that
parents would be bringing children to school over unimproved streets.

Mr. Zenoff pointed out that the Board of Adjustment had approved this
application for Use Permit with the condition that public streets are
dedicated and improved to provide two means of traffic access. He
further stated that a traffic count at the present location of the
Jewish Community Center at 13th and Carson had been made and it was
found that between 8:00 and 9:15 A.M. there were twenty-four automobiles
that stopped and in the afternoon there were thirty-nine automobiles,
which he claimed was not an appreciable amount.

3) The next objection was concerning the fact that the Jewish Community
Center proposes to operate a "nursery school". Mr. Zenoff stated that
it was a pre-kindergarten school which is similar in nature to public
schools by reason of the fact that actual classes are taught. He
further advised the Commission that he had present Mrs. Jacob Kozloff,
organizer of this school, Mrs. Walter McCall, Jr., one of the teachers,
Harley Harmon, one of the parents of a child who had attended the school,
and Rabbi Arthur Lebowitz.

Thereafter Mesdames Kozloff, McCall, Messrs. Harmon, David Goldwater and Rabbi
Lebowitz spoke briefly and requested that the Commission approve this application for
a Use Permit.

His Honor asked if there were any questions that the Board would like to ask.

At this time V. Gray Gubler, representing the protestants appeared and asked Mr. Zenoff
several questions concerning the anticipated increase in the number of children permitted
to attend the school, and if it wouldn't be possible to have the school located somewhere
other than in conjunction with the Synagogue.

Mr. Gubler informed the Commission that his clients were not objecting to the granting
of the Use Permit for a church or synagogue, but that they did object to the installation
of the school for the following reasons:

1)	Such a use is not permissible under the Land Use Plan.

2)	This installation would depreciate the value of property neighboring and
for a reasonable distance thereto.

3)	It would create a traffic hazard, also hazardous to small children living
in the area.

4)	The streets surrounding this proposed location are not improved nor are
they of standard width. There would also be difficulty in finding suffic-
ient access streets since 16th and 17th Streets are not cut through from
Charleston Boulevard.

Mr. Gubler further pointed out that it was their feeling that in order for the
5-25-55

PUBLIC HEARING
Jewish Community
Center
Commission to grant a Use Permit, that such use had to be for the public health and
welfare, and that this point had not been proven to their satisfaction.

Mr. Jack Leavitt, owner of property adjoining this proposed site, also spoke in protest
to the installation of the pre-kindergarten school.

Mr. Gubler then requested permission to take a standing count of the protestants present
at the meeting. The following persons were present:

Messrs. Larry Bair

Roy McGinnis
Wayne Zieger
Joseph A. Berg
Harry Bartell
Harvey Freestone
Art Smith
O. E. Norman
Art E. McKenzie
Mr. & Mrs. William Kelsey
Orval Milk
Ralph A. Leigon
Jack Leavitt
Paul J. Smitley
E. C. Olsen
Mrs. R. R. Carey
John Licini
W. H. Cook
Dr. Tecumseh McCall
Dr. & Mrs. Joel Holmes

Thereafter the Board determined that this application for Use Permit should be taken under
advisement and the applicants requested to submit a detailed lay-out of the plans, location
of proposed construction on this property, and clarification on the right-of-way,
proposed widths and improvement of said streets, before final determination is made.

Messrs. Zenoff and Gubler were informed that they would be advised when the Commission
was prepared to render a decision in this regard.

At the hour of 9:25 P.M. the meeting recessed. The meeting reconvened at the hour of
9:45 P.M. with all members present as of the opening session.

Mr. William Loretta presented the request of Mr. James Harris for permission to move a
two-room residence from 307 Madison to the southwest comer of "I" and Monroe Streets.

Mr. Loretta advised the Commission that the details had been checked by the Building
Department and recommended the approval of this application for house moving.

Thereafter Commissioner Sharp moved the recommendation of the Superintendent of Building
and Safety be accepted and the application of James Harris to move this structure from
307 Madison to the southwest comer of "I" and Monroe approved, subject to compliance
with the provisions of the Building Code.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Bunker, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; nay, Commissioner Jarrett.

Director of Public Works George E. Wade requested permission to construct a road from the
extension of Bonanza Road to the sewage disposal plant. Mr. Wade stated that he had
received informal bids from two contractors as follows:

Lembke-Clough and King	$3860

Industrial Construction	2950

Stewart & Wells	No bid

Mr. Wade recommended that he be given permission to further negotiate with Industrial
Construction to ascertain whether or not this work can be done within a reasonable length
of time at a lower price.

Commissioner Bunker moved the recommendation of the Director of Public Works be approved
and that negotiations proceed.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Bunker, Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; nay, none.

Chief of Police A. H. Kennedy submitted a report on the operation of the Downtown Civic and
Social Club, located at 126½ North 1st Street.

Thereafter Commissioner Whipple moved that George Harmon, licensee for the Downtown Civic
and Social Club, be notified to appear before the Board at the next regular meeting on
June 1, 1955 to show cause why the club liquor license issued this organization should
not be revoked.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Bunker, Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; nay, none.

July 6, 1955

A regular meeting of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada
held this 6th day of July, 1955 was called to order at the hour of 7:30 P.M. by His
Honor Mayor Baker with the following members present:

Mayor	C. D. Baker

Commissioner	E. W. Fountain

Commissioner	Harris P. Sharp

Commissioner	Reed Whipple

City Manager	A. H. Kennedy

Assistant City Manager	Robert W. Notti

City Engineer	George E. Wade

Planning Director	Franklin Bills

City Clerk	Shirley Ballinger

Absent:	Commissioner	Wendell Bunker

City Attorney	Howard W. Cannon

At this time the application of Mrs. Billy Wallace for a use permit to convert an
existing dwelling into a physician's office at 1100 E. San Francisco Avenue was consider-
ed. The Board of Adjustment recommended that this application be denied because of
protests of property owners and due to the fact that this property was converted into
a physician's office prior to any action by an official body of the City.

The Commission was advised that Dr. and Mrs. E. Basse Wallace had filed an appeal on
June 27, 1955, in protest of the denial of this application for use permit.

Mrs. Billy Wallace appeared before the Board and presented a petition in favor of the
granting of this use permit, signed by property owners within the vicinity. Mrs.

Wallace stated that of the twenty property owners within the 300 foot area, seventeen
had signed the petition favoring this installation.

His Honor asked if there were any protestants present.

Mrs. Lee Payne of 2307 Beverly Way appeared in protest and stated that Mr. and Mrs. Fred
McGowan also objected to this Use Permit.

At this time City Attorney Howard W. Cannon arrived at the meeting.

Commissioner Whipple moved that a public hearing on the appeal of the denial of this
Use Permit be held on August 3; 1955 at 7:30 P.M.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent: Commissioner
Bunker.

The Board considered the application of Ralph Seward for a use permit to establish a
real estate office at 1701-03-05 E. Charleston Boulevard. This application was
recommended for approval by the Board of Adjustment, providing that streets, curbs and
sidewalks are installed in conformance with those in this area.

Thereafter Commissioner Whipple moved the recommendation of the Board of Adjustment be
accepted and this application approved, and the following resolution adopted:

BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, in a
regular meeting on the 6th day of July, 1955; having considered the application of Ralph
Seward for a use permit to establish a real estate office on property situated at 1701-
03-05 East Charleston Boulevard, being Lots 1 and 2 in Block 7 of amended map of Mayfair
Tract #2, in an R-4 zone; and

The Board having considered the recommendation of the Board of Adjustment approving this
application,

NOW, THEREFORE, it is the decision of this Board that the application of Ralph Seward
for a use permit to establish a real estate office at 1701-03-05 East Charleston on Lots
1 and 2 in Block 7 of amended map of Mayfair Tract #2 be approved subject to the
condition that sidewalks, curbs and paving are installed at the applicant's own expense
in conformity with those in the surrounding area, and the inspection department are
hereby authorized to issue the necessary permits.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent: Commissioner
Bunker.

The application of Ernest A. Becker for a variance to allow a twenty (20) foot front
yard where twenty-five (25) feet are required at 508 Falcon Lane (Lot 3 and the north
half of Lot 4, Block 10, Charleston Heights Tract #3), was considered. It was the
recommendation of the Board of Adjustment that this application be denied since it
was felt that there was no real hardship involved, other applications of a like nature
had been previously denied, and further since the owner had completed most of the
construction prior to applying for a variance.

Thereafter Commissioner Sharp moved the recommendation of the Board of Adjustment that
this application be denied be accepted, and the following resolution adopted:

BE IT RESOLVED, by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, in a
regular meeting on the 6th day of July, 1955, having considered the application of
Ernest A. Becker for variance to allow a twenty (20) foot front yard where twenty-five
(25) feet are required on Lot 3 and the north half of Lot 4, Block 10, Charleston
Heights Tract No. 3; and

The Board having considered the recommendation of the Board of Adjustment denying this
application;

NOW, THEREFORE, it is the decision of the Board that the application of Ernest A. Becker
for variance to allow a twenty (20) foot front yard instead of a twenty-five (25) foot
setback on Lot 3 and the north half of Lot 4, Block 10, Charleston Heights Tract No. 3,
be and the same hereby is denied.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent: Commissioner
Bunker.

The Commission considered the application of the Homesite Baptist Church for variance to
build within five feet of the side property line at Cedar Avenue between 23rd and 25th
Streets, being Lots 21 to 30 of Block 2, Boulder Dam Homesite Tract No. 4. The Board of
Adjustment recommended that this variance be approved because a five foot side yard is the
minimum requirement in this R-1 zone, the Church had unsuccessfully attempted to purchase
adjoining property to the west, and the proposed structure added to the existing church
makes it impractical to locate the building in any other manner.

Thereafter Commissioner Whipple moved this application for variance be approved and the
following resolution adopted:

BE IT RESOLVED, by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, in a
regular meeting on the 6th day of July, 1955, having considered the application of the
Homesite Community Baptist Church for a variance to allow a five foot side yard on Lots
21 to 30 of Block 2, Boulder Dam Homesite Tract No. 4; and

The Board having considered the recommendation of the Board of Adjustment approving this
application,

NOW, THEREFORE, it is the decision of this Board that the application of the Homesite
Community Baptist Church to allow a five foot side yard on Lots 21 to 30 of Block 2, Boulder
Dam Homesite Tract No. 4 be approved, and the inspection departments are hereby authorized
to issue the necessary permits.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent: Commissioner
Bunker.

The application of E. W. Fountain for a variance to permit the property at 313 North 6th
Street to be developed as an off-street parking lot for tenants of an adjoining commercial
building, was considered at this time. It was brought to the attention of the Commission
that the notices sent out for the public hearing held by the Board of Adjustment had not
had the proper legal description in that they showed Lot 7 of Block 2, Buck's Subdivision
instead of Lot 8 of said block and addition.

Commissioner Whipple moved this application for variance be referred back to the Board of
Adjustment to correct the legal description and rehear the matter before making recommen-
dation to the Board of Commissioners.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent: Commissioner
Bunker.

The Commission considered the application of the National Builders Inc. for variance to
allow construction of a single family dwelling on a lot 40 feet in width at 212 Circle
Drive, described as Lot 29, Block 8 of Mayfair Addition No. 2. It was recommended by the
Board of Adjustment that this application be approved because the lot is worthless unless
it can be built upon in some manner, investigation indicated a possible error in the
original layout of the subdivision, and the minimum front, rear and side yard require-
ments will be met in the proposed construction.

ers Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent: Commission-
er Bunker.

The request of George Heyer for extension of time on a use permit granted for a shopping
center at Bonanza and Rancho Roads was held over until the next regular meeting of the

released subject to the final cleanup and backfill behind the sidewalks in this subdivision.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent: Commissioner

The Director of Public Works presented the preliminary plans for the improvement of the
Westside area, namely from A to H Streets, between West Bonanza and the north City limits,
by the installation of sewers and curb, gutter and paving.

It was the recommendation of the Director of Public Works that the bids received for
the construction of lavatories and a storage room at the Golf Course, known as Bid No.
55.11 be rejected due to the fact that the lowest bid was $5,002.00, and the money
budgeted for this construction was not sufficient. Mr. Wade further recommended that
if the installation of these facilities was needed it could possibly be done at a
later date under forced account.

Commissioner Sharp moved that all bids received for Bid No. 55*11 be rejected due to

At this time City Engineer George Wade presented the revised tentative map of the

possible means of providing adequate drainage for this proposed subdivision.

It was the request of the Commission that this map be referred back to the Subdivider
for preparation of a corrected revised map and presentation to the Board when this
is ready.

Consideration was given to the annexation petition of Bisno and Bisno concerning
approximately 10 acres in Section 21, T20S, R61E, which was referred to the
Engineering Department to check the possibility of this property being served
by the sewer. Action on this petition was continued until clarification is

they also request permission to install a sidewalk elevator on South 3rd Street,
forty-five feet north of the alley, and recommended that both of these requests be
approved.

Commissioner Fountain moved this request for erection of a pedestrian walkway and
installation of a sidewalk elevator for the 3-story office building at 3rd and
Fremont Streets be approved.

the Board that Mr. Funk, a member of the Thrifty Liquor Grill Inc. had operated
this liquor store at the former location of 28 Fremont for a period of 3½ years.

Messrs. George and Robert Rapoport were also present and advised the Commission

July 20, 1955

A regular meeting of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada,
held this 20th day of July, 1955 was called to order at the hour of 7:30 P.M. by

Representatives of the following club liquor licensees were present, at the request
of the Commission, concerning the operation of the bars in their organizations:

American Legion
Adavens Key Club
Footprinters Club
Sheriff's Mounted Posse
Silver State Elks Lodge

Mayor Baker advised these licensees that the purpose of requesting their presence
was to discuss the policy of the Commission in conjunction with the club liquor
license issued to charitable and service organizations. His Honor advised these
licensees that complaints have been received that some of the organizations have
not been careful about serving non-members, and are actually in competition with
the regular bars who pay a much greater license fee. He stated further that there
has been some resentment when members of the Police Department come into the
organizations and ask questions from whomever is in charge as to the conducting of
the bar, membership and persons in charge of the organization. His Honor then
advised those present that the following restrictions had been imposed on club
liquor licenses:

1)	Only members of the organization and guests accompanied by members
are to be served on the premises. Membership lists should be posted
near the bar and checked by the bartender.

2)	When meetings are held by other groups than the licensee, the privileges
of the bar are not to be extended to them.

3)	No minors are to be allowed on the premises or as members of the
organization.

4)	Copies of the By-laws of the organization are to be filed with the
City Clerk.

5)	Police Department is to make a periodic check and report to the
Commission.

Mr. James Berkible from the Footprinters Association and Mr. Harold Jones of the
Sheriff's Mounted Posse discussed aspects of the rules governing this type of liquor
license and promised cooperation with the Commission in observing the same.

The Commission advised those present that the liquor ordinances were in the process of
being amended and these restrictions would be included. Commissioners Fountain and
Whipple, members of the committee to make recommendation on this proposed ordinance
indicated that copies would be available to the organization prior to adoption.

Commissioner Sharp stated that he felt that all organizations were aware of the
conditions imposed on the club liquor license and so long as they are abided by,
everything will be fine; however, if the Commission receive reports that there
are any flagrant violations he will be the first to vote to revoke the license.

His Honor then stated that none of the organizations represented were in violation
according to the last check made by the Police Department. He indicated that they
were in the clear now, and advised them to remain that way.

Mr. Edwin Dotson, representing George Harmon of the Downtown Civic & Social Club
was present at this time and stated that they had no further information regarding
the investigation of this organization since the last meeting. Mr. Dotson assured
the Commission that the Club would cooperate with all the rules of the Commission
and requested that this license be continued. The Commission asked how many active
members there were in this organization, and were advised that there are approximately

400.

Thereafter Commissioner Sharp moved the club liquor license of the Downtown Civic and
Social Club, 126½ North 1st Street, be reinstated subject to compliance with the
ordinances and provisions set forth by the Commission.

The licensees, Messrs. Robert and Abe Kroloff were present, along with their

been returned; the Board was further-advised that this was not the first instance
that this had happened.

The Board questioned Mr. Bardy on his financial ability to operate this business
and asked him whether or not he was planning to sell the Lido Bar. Mr. Bardy stated
that he had very little overhead in the operation of the bar, was paying cash for
his stock and hereafter would pay for his license in cash. He further requested the
Commission to allow him to continue this operation and indicated he would sell only
in the event he is unable to make expenses.

August 16, 1955 on this use permit.

Commissioner Bunker moved that Mr. Clem Malone be requested to appear before the
Board to show why he had not complied with the requirements for the installation of
the trailer park.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote: Commission-
ers Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

At this time Mr. John McNamee appeared before the Commission on behalf of the Aqua
Hotel Corporation, 1401 South 5th Street, applicant for a tavern liquor license.

He represented John and Pat Cashen, Charles Rosenthal and himself.

The Commission was advised that a use permit for this hotel to allow the operation of
a bar in a C-2 zone could not be granted at this time due to the fact that the
Planning and Zoning Ordinance does not permit this type of business in a hotel of
less than 100 rooms. At the present time the Aqua Hotel has approximately 68 rooms.

Commissioner Bunker moved that the application of Aqua Hotel Corporation for a tavern
liquor license be held in abeyance.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote: Commission-
ers Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

At the hour of 9:05 the meeting adjourned, reconvening at 9:20 P.M. with all members

Robert Rapoport, applicants for a retail liquor miniature license. He said that they
had a location for their liquor store which would be named Ethel's Family Liquor Store
at 917 East Charleston Boulevard. He stated that they had made no attempt to sell
their license. He further stated that the trust estate has been terminated by order
of the Court, June 13, 1955, and that the Rapoport Brothers have been endeavoring to
find a location and use the license.

Mr. Milton Keefer, representing John Funk and Mr. Earl J. Atkins, stated that he
believed that his clients have qualified in every respect to continue their license,
and requested approval of their application.

There being two applications on file for the retail liquor miniature license of the
Downtown Liquor Store, formerly located at 28 Fremont, one by Robert and George
Rapoport to be transferred to 917 E. Charleston and the other of Thrifty Liquor and
Grill, Inc. by John L. Funk to be transferred to 2109 Fremont, Commissioner Sharp
moved that inasmuch as Mr. Funk was operating the business at the time it was closed
because of the termination of the lease, and since he has an investment in stock for
the business of approximately $16,000.00, that this liquor license be granted to the
Thrifty Liquor and Grill Inc. at 2109 Fremont.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote: Commission-
ers Bunker, Fountain, Sharp and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Commissioner
Whipple passed his vote stating that the First National Bank had no interest in this
business, but had acted as Trustees of the Estate of Ethel Rapoport.

of City radio equipment, the following bids were opened:

A regular meeting of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada,
held this 3rd day of August, 1955 was called to order at the hour of 7:30 P.M.
by His Honor Mayor Baker with the following members present:

This being the time set for the public hearing on the appeal of the denial of the
application of Mrs. Billy Wallace for a permit to convert an existing dwelling into
an office for a physician and provide parking on property situated at 1100 E. San
Francisco Street (Lot 21, Block 1, Van Patten Tract No. 1 and Lot 22, Block 1,

Van Patten Tract No. 2), the matter was considered by the Board. This application
was denied by the Board of Adjustment on June 23, 1955, because of protests of
property owners and residents and because the property was converted into an
physician's office prior to any official approval. Appeal of this decision was
filed by Dr. Wallace on June 27, 1955.

Mr. Joe Foley, representing Dr. and Mrs. Wallace appeared before the Board at this
time, stated that due to Mrs. Wallace's being ill and in a hospital in Loma Linda,
the Wallaces were unable to be present. He said that there were approximately 20
persons residing within 300 feet of the area in question, and that he had signatures
of 17 people favoring the granting of this use permit.

Mayor Baker asked if there were any objections to the granting of this use permit.

Mrs. Lee Payne, 2204 Beverly Way, stated that she felt the neighbors would not object
to one doctor practicing at this location but that they did not want a clinic to be
held there. Mr. Foley said that it was intended only for Dr. Wallace's office. Mrs.
Payne said that they were willing to withdraw their objections if only Dr. Wallace
uses the office.

City Attorney Howard Cannon said that the application was for a doctor's office
and that it could not be turned into a clinic or hospital type use without being
brought before the Board for a change. However, it could not be limited to Dr. Wallace's
use but could be used by any doctor.

Mr. Foley asked Mrs. Payne how far away her home was. She stated that it was less
than 200 feet and that the office was visible from her back yard.

Mayor Baker stated that property on San Francisco Street had been rezoned R-4.

Thereafter Commissioner Fountain moved that the use permit be issued to Mrs. Billy
Wallace for use of one doctor's office, and the following resolution adopted:

BE IT RESOLVED, by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, in a
regular meeting on the 3rd day of August, 1955; having considered the application of
Mrs. Billy Wallace for a use permit to convert an existing dwelling into an office for
a physician and provide parking on property situated at 1100 E. San Francisco Street
(Lot 21, Block 1, Van Patten Tract No. 1 and Lot 22, Block 1, Van Patten Tract No. 2);
and

The Board having considered the recommendation of the Board of Adjustment denying
this application,

NOW, THEREFORE, it is the decision of this Board that the application of Mrs. Billy
Wallace for a use permit to convert an existing dwelling into an office for a physician
and provide parking on property situated at 1100 E. San Francisco Street (Lot 21, Block
1, Van Patten Tract No. 1 and Lot 22, Block 1, Van Patten Tract No. 2) be approved.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote: Commissioners

licenses for the third quarter of 1955 be approved:

Commissioner Whipple moved that the extension of the agreement with the Clark County
Humane Society for operation of the animal pound he approved and the Mayor and Clerk
authorized to sign same.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

City Engineer George Wade reported that two proposals were received regarding a lease
purchase plan for automotive equipment; one proposal from Cashman (GMC Truck Co. ) and
the other from Gaudin Motor Company (Ford). Analysis of the two proposals indicate
that Gaudin Motor Company is the low bidder at $1534.00 per vehicle, Cashman's bid
being $1560.37 per vehicle.

Mr. Wade requested that authorization be granted to purchase 18 vehicles, 9 of which
are replacements of present vehicles. The monthly payments would be between $50.00
and $69.70, the down payment being two monthly payments. At the present time the City
is paying approximately $675.00 a month for car rentals. This lease purchase contract
would be on a twenty four month's basis. Twelve of the vehicles would be pick-up
trucks and the other six business coupes.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the recommendation of the City Engineer be accepted and
that authorization be granted to purchase 18 vehicles for the City on the lease
purchase plan from Gaudin Motors.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote: Commission-
ers Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

This being the time set for the public hearing on the land use plan for the Bonanza Road
area, the matter was considered by the Board.	

Mr. Franklin Bills, Planning Director, stated that the map which he exhibited was not a
zoning plan, but that it was a general neighborhood plan for this particular area,
hoping that it will became the impetus of a land use plan for the entire city. While
not a zoning plan, it will probably have an effect on future zoning.

Mr. Bills indicated the following areas on the map:

Yellow - Low density residential

Orange - Medium density residential - Not R-E or R-4, possibly R-1
and R-2

Brown - High density residential - R-3 and R-4, including limited
Commercial zoning

Mr. Joe Hufford asked if this new plan would be laying the foundation for the City to
raise exhorbitant taxes.

Mayor Baker stated that Mr. Hufford was undoubtedly getting the city mixed up with
the county assessor. He explained that the City Charter had been changed so that the
assessments can be levied up to 100% of the assessed valuation of the property in
street or sewer improvement districts.

Mr. D. H. Hand said that he felt that this land use plan would lay the ground work for
future zoning without repeated applications for variances.

Mayor Baker stated that, having heard the recommendations of the Planning Director
and those present, he would like to entertain a motion to take this map under advisement
until September 7, 1955.

Commissioner Bunker moved that the land use map of the Bonanza Road area be taken under
advisement until the regular meeting on September 7, 1955.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

At this time Mr. Frank McCully appeared before the Board to show cause why his contractor's
license should not be revoked. He said that he had signed a contract with Rose Holding
Corporation and that Mr. Davidson was superintendent of the building at 106-112 Van Buren.

He further stated that Mr. Alvin Rose had told him that a zone change was pending on the
property and that it would be zoned R-4. He stated that he had noticed on one of his
trips to the building that there were too many electric meters.

Mr. Joe McDonald appeared at the meeting on behalf of Mr. McCully.

Commissioner Sharp asked on whose authority the building was changed to ten units. Mr.
McCully said that Mr. Rose had explained to him that all inspections had been made and
that it was in order.

His Honor asked Mr. McCully if he felt any responsibility as a contractor, or if he
would conduct his business in the future in such a manner that it would be necessary
for him to appear before the Board again.

Mr. Mc Cully said that he would check with the proper departments of the City on all
future building plans.

Mr. McDonald said that they were having trouble getting the people out of the building
so that conversion could be started, but that it would be completed within the
required 60 days.

Supervisor of Building and Safety, William Loretta, said that at 11:15 A.M. of August
3rd an inspection of the building was made by the fire department and building
inspector and that no progress had been made.

Commissioner Whipple moved this matter be held in abeyance until August 17; that the
Building Department inspect to determine if this structure is converted back to conform,
if not that the necessary legal steps be taken to demolish or convert the structure
to a conforming use, at the owner's expense.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

The Mayor announced that this was the time and place designated for the Board of Commission-
ers to receive and publicly open bids for the contractor's proposal for street improvement
of South "A" Street, paving of South "A" between Oakey Boulevard and Boston Avenue and
the construction of a storm drain from South "A" to South Main Street, known as Bid
No. 55.13.

No bids were received.

At this time Mr. C. Van Patten appeared before the Board to show cause why his contractor's
license should not be revoked.

His Honor stated that certain deficiencies of construction in Van Patten Tract No. 2 were
noted and that Mr. Van Patten had appeared before the Board approximately six months
ago. Mayor Baker said that the Commission would like to have an explanation as to why
this matter had not been taken care of.

Mr. Oscar Bryan, representing Mr. Van Patten, quoted a letter from the City dated
February 21, 1955, and asked Mr. Van Patten if he had complied with the requests stated
therein. Mr. Van Patten said that he had with the exception of the bases for the
carport posts.

Thereafter Mr. Cannon read reports on inspections of this tract from the Building
Department under dates of February 23; 1955; May 4, 1955 and July 19, 1955 which are as
follows:

February 23; 1955

Forty-two houses comprises this tract, of which about thirty-five to forty were
constructed by James T. Van Patten, General Contractor and sub-divider.

It is understood that these houses were built (for sale) and in most instances have
been occupied for about one year. Some of them are connected with F.H.A., some with the
Veterans Administration, and some with both.

Complaints from owners, regarding structural and architectural failures of their houses,
have come to the City Building Department in great numbers since a period dating back
several months. Because of certain conditions under the floors which involved extreme
moisture (mud, etc.) a thorough inspection was postponed until access holes were opened
and sub-floor areas dried to allow for proper inspection. May it be understood that
due to lack of time allowable for unit to unit inspection, only a few (eight) were more
or less covered completely by inspection and a few others partially. However, because of
the constant phase to phase failures and code violations found in the few, it is reason-
able to assume that these conditions exist in all or at least a great portion of each and
every building.

Following is a descriptive listing of structural failures, code violations, and evident
non-compliance to plans and specifications:

Trenches - footings - foundations.

Most trenches were not deep enough, some deleted. Carport footings have been deleted.
Footings under bearing walls are 2" to 6" in thickness; they are ragged, raveled and in
a state of great unconformity; much evidence of settlement. Elevation as to proper
grade lines of foundation are too low. Vents and access holes are too close to finished
grade allowing for water seepage into sub-floor areas; access wells deleted. Concrete
walks badly cracked and show extensive settlement and heaving buckling, or both. Some
walks, porches and driveways are separating from the buildings, others are being carried
downward with wall settlement as much as two inches or more. Many vertical cracks
emerge from the foundations and continue to the top plate lines. Horizontal cracks
follow haphazard courses of the masonry near and around all openings. Carports and
storage rooms are settling and pulling their roofs from the main building walls.

Plumbing stacks are not supported by block footings.

Masonry walls.

Test borings were made in many places throughout the exterior walls, so that reinforcing
steel and grout may be observed. A few bars were observed, but in no case was grout
found to be in place around openings and in no case was steel found under openings.

All masonry walls in all houses investigated are badly cracked. Local area settlement
is common to most houses.

Floors-Girders-Interior Bearing Supports.

Girders in all houses inspected are resting on 2" x 8" fir lumber posts set on or into
bare earth. Clearance under floors not sufficient, - less than one foot in many places.
There are no mud sills on center bearing foundation. Bearing foundations are not in
correct position to support interior bearing partitions. One bearing foundation in
each house seems to be deleted. Floor joist spans are too great for grade of lumber
used and they are resting in direct contact with cinder block without sills. There is
no bridging. Many joists are of such poor grade (innumerable knots and faulty grain)
that they have sagged, cracked and many are broken, - (owners have patched and supported
some of them.) All floors are sagging toward the center of spans and toward settled
exterior walls. All floors are unstable as to vibration and live loads as from human
tread. Most floors have dropped at inner wall base plates. Bath tubs have separated
down from the ceramic tile as much as 3/4 of an inch or more.

Ceilings and Roofs.

Ceilings have no bridging (deleted). Strong backs and ribbon fir deleted. Many ceiling
joists are warped, and have caused plaster failure.

Roofs improperly supported. Purlins deleted -- knee bracing spacing extended from four
feet to seven and eight feet which causes deletion of two to three. Some houses have
sections of roof (large areas and entire sides) without any support whatever. This
creates for exceptionally long rafter spans - far in excess of Code requirements. Many
roofs have sagged. Same are in evident state of collapse.

Ledger plates supporting carport rafters are all of 2" x 4", nailed to masonry walls.
Deleted are the 2" x 6" and bolts.

This report may not be considered as final nor in complete detail.

May 4, 1955

On Feb. 21, 1955 the following people were present at a meeting called to discuss the
deficiencies existing in the dwellings at Van Patten Tract #2:

Mr. Ewalt Anderson, Residence Representative

Mr. D. Kent, 1031 South Broadway, Los Angeles; VA Representative
Mr. Larson, Local VA Representative (Inspector)

Mr. Meecham, Local VA Inspector

Mr. Felix Land, State Contractor's Board

Mr. Van Patten.

In order to overcame the deficiencies existing in the dwellings located in the Van
Patten Tract #2, the following was recommended, and Mr. Van Patten registered a verbal
commitment to follow through as recommended.

1.	Provide 4x6 girder mid-span where necessary under floor.

2.	To establish dry piers to support said girder.

3.	Provide pads under carport posts; anchor carport rafters to main building.

4.	Add bracing in roof area as per plan.

5.	Reinforcing steel at openings— to be determined later as to what approach is
necessary to adjust to plan representation.

6.	All other minor deficiencies to be reviewed by Mr. Van Patten.

To date some small repair has been made but recent investigation reveals non-compliance.

It has come to me unofficially that the occupants are banding and will register a formal
complaint with the VA office and continue litigation from that standpoint.

July 19, 1955

This inspection revealed that very little work has been done to bring these houses up to
Code.

A few piers and girders have been placed under a few houses. Those houses having cracks
in the walls have been roughly patched. (Owners finished the jobs.) Most of the piers
under floors consist of wood blocking set on damp earth and in some places in mud -
very unsuitable. In no case has there been any attempt to underpin or stabilize footings
or foundations. Wood posts (original) are still in place under girders in bedroom areas -

8-3-55
none has been replaced. Many of these houses are still in a state of continuing
settlement.

Following is a list of twelve houses describing present conditions:

Mr. W.E. Loretta passed pictures around to the Commissioners, that were taken
in July, 1955, showing floor joists and under floor conditions.

His Honor asked if anyone had any statements to make regarding these conditions.

Mr. Lee Payne, 2304 Beverly Way, said that the SE corner of his bedroom had no
steel nor grout.

Mr. Dale Kemper, 2212 Beverly Way, said that he thought it was a disgrace to the
City of Las Vegas to let a contractor build such houses.

Messrs. Eldon Dotson, 2312 Van Patten; Fred Grafman, 2212 Van Patten and Edward L.
Gregory, 2301 Van Patten also protested the construction of their homes.

Mr. Stuart Griffith of 2112 Beverly Way said that nothing had been done to repair
his home except that timbers had been placed under the floors. He asked if this
contractor could be made to come back to correct these deficiencies.

His Honor said that this was a contractual matter between the people and Mr. Van
Patten.

Commissioner Fountain said that there was no reason why the City of Las Vegas
should have to allow this type of contracting, and moved that the contractor's
license of Mr. C. Van Patten dba Desert Development Company be revoked.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.
Commissioner Bunker passed his vote stating that he felt Mr. Van Patten
might think he was prejudiced because he has a law suit pending against him.

At the hour of 9:05 P.M. the meeting recessed. The meeting reconvened
at 9:20 P.M. with all members present as of the opening session.

Mr. Clem Malone appeared before the Board at this time to explain the
reason for non-compliance in the installation of a trailer park on H
and Owens. A petition protesting trailer park was presented to the
Commission on June 1, 1955 by the property owners in adjoining area.
Representation of the petition and pictures showing installation of a
wire fence instead of a block wall were made on July 20, 1955.

Mr. Malone stated that the plans showing a wire fence on the property
had been approved by the Board. He said that he intended to plant
oleanders along this fence, which will separata the trailer park from
the residential area.

Mr. Massie Kennard appeared before the Board at this time in protest
to the wire fence and the drainage situation at the trailer park.

The matter was referred to the City Engineer for investigation of the
drainage of this trailer park and report back to the Board.

Planning Director Franklin Bills presented the tentative map of Twin
Lakes Estates No. 1 - NE¼, SE¼, Sec. 30, T20S, R61E, MDB&M. This map
was approved by the Planning Commission subject to check of drainage
by the Engineering Department and agreement with the Las Vegas Union
School District on the school site.

Commissioner Bunker moved that the tentative map of Twin Lakes Estates
No. 1 be approved.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following
vote:	Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor

voting aye; noes, none.

The application of E.W. Fountain to develop and maintain property as
an off-street parking lot for tenants of an adjoining commercial
building at 313 North 6th Street (Lot 8, Block 2, Bucks Subdivision)
was considered by the Board. This variance was approved by the Board
of Adjustment.

His Honor asked if there were any objections. None were voiced.

Thereafter Commissioner Bunker moved that the application of E.W.
Fountain for a variance to develop and maintain property as an off-
street parking lot for tenants of an adjoining commercial building at
313 North 6th Street be approved, and the following resolution adopted:

BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas,
Nevada, in a regular meeting on the 3rd day of August, 1955, having
considered the application of E.W. Fountain for a variance to develop
and maintain property as an off-street parking lot for tenants of an
adjoining commercial building at 313 North 6th Street; and

The Board having considered the recommendation of the Board of Adjust-
ment approving this application;

NOW, THEREFORE, it is the decision of this Board that the application
of E.W. Fountain for a variance to develop and maintain property as
an off-street parking lot for tenants of an adjoining commercial building
at 313 North 6th Street be approved.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following
vote:	Commissioners Bunker, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye;

noes, none. Commissioner Fountain passed his vote.

At this time the Board considered the application of Kax Corporation
to convert six existing triplexes to professional offices not to
exceed twelve suites on property located at 1900-1934 E. Charleston,
between Burnham and Crestwood Avenues (Lots 1 to 6, Block 1, Crestwood
Tract #5). This use permit was approved by the Board of Adjustment
because this property abuts on a primary majorhighway and it has been
the policy of both Commissions to grant this type of use in this area.
This permit was approved subject to the condition that the property
owners at their own expense install the off-site improvements and
complete the service road in the manner required of other property
owners on East Charleston between Crestwood and Eastern Avenues.

Commissioner Whipple moved that public hearing on this use permit
be set for the regular meeting of the Board on September 7, 1955.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following
vote:	Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor

voting aye; noes, none.

At this time the Board considered the application of Samuel M. Davis to
erect a one story professional building on property situated at 404 Maryland
Parkway (Lots 19 and 20, Block 16, Pioneer Heights). This use permit was
approved by the Board of Adjustment because this property abuts a primary
major highway. Similar uses have been approved in this neighborhood and plot
plan indicates adequate set back from the highway and sufficient off street-
parking. The proposed building will accomodate two optometrists.

His Honor asked if there were any objections. None were voiced.

Commissioner Sharp moved that a public hearing on this use permit be held
on September 7, 1955, at 7:30 P.M.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote:

Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye;
noes, none.

Consideration of the Board was given to the application of the Boulder City
Broadcasting Company for a variance to operate a garden nursery on property
situated at 25th Street between Jansen and Owens Avenues. This variance was
approved by the Board of Adjustment because the area adjacent is used for the
radio transmission towers and is therefore undesirable for residential use;
set back is more than adequate to meet any contemplated street widening, and
ample area will be provided for off-street parking.

His Honor asked if there were any objections. None were voiced.

Thereafter Commissioner Bunker moved that the application of Boulder City
Broadcasting Company for a variance be approved, and the following resolution
adopted:

BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada,
in a regular meeting on the 3rd day of August, 1955, having considered the
application of the Boulder City Broadcasting Company for a variance to operate
a garden nursery on property situated at 25th Street between Jansen and Owens
Avenues; and

The Board having considered the recommendation of the Board of Adjustment
approving this application;

NOW, THEREFORE, it is the decision of this Board that the application of Boulder
City Broadcasting Company for a variance to operate a garden nursery on property
situated at 25th Street between Jansen and Owens Avenues be approved.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

At this time the Board considered the application of M.D. Schroeder to construct
to within 18'4" of the rear yard line where 25 feet are required at 3300 Westleigh
Drive (Lot 9, Block 11, Westleigh #5)/ This application was approved by the Board
of Adjustment because plot plan indicated that it would be difficult to re-design
proposed dwelling to meet all open space requirements; this corner lot is bounded
in the rear by a 20' dedicated alley which would make the distance between the rear
line of the dwelling as proposed and the nearest adjacent private property approxi-
mately 38'.

His Honor asked if there were any objections. None were voiced.

Thereafter Commissioner Sharp moved that the application of M.D. Schroeder for a
variance be approved subject to inspection of the Building Department and compliance
with the set-back ordinance be approved, and the following resolution adopted:

BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, in
a regular meeting on the 3rd day of August, 1955, having considered the application
of M.D. Schroeder to construct to within 18'4" of the rear yard line where 25 feet

this application:

NOW THEREFORE, it is the decision of this Board that the application of M.D. Schroeder
to construct to within 18'4" of the rear yard line where 25 feet are required at 3300
Westleigh Drive (lot 9, Block 11, Westleigh #5) be approved, subject to inspection
of the Building Department and compliance with the set-back ordinance.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Consideration of the Board was given to the application of Olivia Bravo to replace
present store building used for the outlet of retail groceries at 410 Morgan Street
(Lot 6, Block 25, Original Las Vegas Townsite). This application for variance was
denied by the Board of Adjustment because this property is located in an R-4 zone
and is presently a legal non-conforming use as long as it is not expanded or changed
and it is the basic principle of zoning that non-conforming uses be eliminated at such
time as they are abandoned or value has been amortized; further this area is not
included within the confines of any commercial zone yet contemplated by Lane Use
Plans of the Planning Commission.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the application of Olivia Bravo to replace the
present store at 410 Morgan Street be held in abeyance.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye;

At this time the Board considered the application of the American
Legion Post #8 to construct a building at 733 North 2nd Street,
between Bonanza Road and Naval Reserve Armory. This application
was approved by the Board of Adjustment because it is adjacent
to other semi-public uses and plot plan indicates that it is
located in a manner that will cause a minimum of conflict with
residential uses.

Thereafter Commissioner Sharp moved that the application of the
American Legion Post #8 for a variance be approved and the follow-
ing resolution adopted:

BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas,
Nevada, in a regular meeting on the 3rd day of August, 1955, having
considered the application of the American Legion Post #8 for a
variance to construct a building at 733 North 2nd Street, between
Bonanza Road and the Naval Reserve Armory; and

The Board having considered the recommendation of the Board of
Adjustment approving this application;

NOW, THEREFORE, it is the decision of this Board that the application
of the American Legion Post #8 for a variance to construct a building
at 733 North 2nd Street, between Bonanza Road and the Naval Reserve
Armory, be approved.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following
vote: Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor
voting aye; noes, none.

Consideration of the Board was given to the application of William
Jackson to allow building inside the rear yard. Said building to
be upstairs with the first floor open for parking, at 1107-09 D
Street (Lots 5 and 6, Block 3, Valley View Addition). Denied by
the Board of Adjustment because four dwellings already exist on
the property; the proposed second floor construction on supporting
pillars would be detrimental to the neighborhood which enforcement
agencies of the City are trying to improve.

Thereafter Commissioner Fountain moved that the application of
William Jackson to allow building inside the rear yard at 1107-
09 D Street be denied and the following resolution adopted:

BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las
Vegas, Nevada, in a regular meeting on the 3rd day of August,

1955, having considered the application of William Jackson for
a Variance to allow building inside the rear yard at 1107-09

The Board having considered the recommendation of the Board of
Adjustment denying this application;

NOW, THEREFORE, it is the decision of this Board that the application
of William Jackson for a variance to allow building inside the rear
yard at 1107-09 D Street be denied.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following
vote: Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor
voting aye; noes, none.

At this time the Board considered the application of the Roman
Catholic Bishop of Reno to erect an addition to St. Anne's Catholic
Church to within seven feet of the rear lot line, on Lot 2, Block
19, Huntridge Tract #4. This application was approved by the Board
of Adjustment because plans show that the part of the proposed
addition will not extend into the rear yard further than an existing
accessory structure; additional living space is needed to provide
quarters for additional Sisters required for instruction of pupils
in the Parochial School systems. The Church contemplates the purchase
at a later date of the only private property affected by this application.

His Honor asked if there were any objections. None were voiced.

Thereafter Commissioner Bunker moved that the application of the
Roman Catholic Bishop of Reno for a variance be approved and the
following resolution adopted:

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes,
none. Commissioner Sharp passed his vote.

Consideration of the Board was given to the application of L.B. Scherer
to extend an unenclosed canopy 5'9" into a required side yard where 2'
is permitted at 1100 South 10th Street. This application was approved
by the Board of Adjustment because this 70' wide lot requires a 7'
open side yard and the design shows that the canopy must extend the requested
distance in order to achieve a useful purpose.

His Honor asked if there were any objections. None were voiced.

Thereafter Commissioner Whipple moved that the application of L.B.

Scherer for a variance be approved and the following resolution adopted:

BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas,

Nevada, in a regular meeting on the 3rd day of August, 1955, having

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

At this time the Board considered the application of Mary K. Tomlinson to allow
Mrs. Myrill Rabb to operate a private school at 1107 Desert Lane. This application
was approved by the Board of Adjustment because there is a need for additional
facilities for instruction of pre-school children. This property has a sizable
outdoor fenced play area, adequate room for classes and sanitary facilities. The
property is located less than 100' from a primary major highway and across the
street from a church. A signed statement from immediate adjacent neighbors
indicate that they do not feel that this use is detrimental.

His Honor asked if there were any objections. None were voiced.

Mr. Herb Jones appeared on behalf of the applicant, Mrs. Myril Rabb.

Thereafter Commissioner Whipple moved that the application of Mary K. Tomlinson
to allow Mrs. Myrill Rabb to operate a private school at 1107 Desert Lane be
approved and the following resolution adopted:

BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada,

application of Mary K. Tomlinson to allow Mrs. Myrill Rabb to operate a private

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye;
noes, none.

The Board considered the application of Bert O'Donnell to store and sell
chemicals in a warehouse at 123 W. Colorado Street in an M-2 zone. This
application was approved by the Board of Adjustment.

Commissioner Sharp moved that a public hearing on the application of Bert
O'Donnell for a use permit be held on September 7, 1955, at 7:30 P.M.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners BUnker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye;
noes, none.

At this time the Board considered the application of the City of Las Vegas
to construct an animal pound under supervision of the SPCA on property
described as a portion of the SW¼ of NW¼ of NE¼ of Section 36, T20S, R61E,
MDB&M. This application was approved by the Board of Adjustment because
there is a public need for removal of the present pound from its location
which is close to developed residential district and this area is relatively
undeveloped at this time.

Commissioner Sharp moved that a public hearing be held on this application
of the City of Las Vegas to construct an animal pound under the supervision of
the SPCA, at the regular meeting of the Board on September 7, 1955, at 7:30 P.M.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:

be eliminated on 5th Street from South City Limits to Oakey Blvd.

At this time Director of Public Works George E. Wade recommended
the acceptance of improvements and release of bonds on Stock
Subdivision #1 in the amount of $13,500.00. Mr. Wade reported
that all work has been completed in accordance with the agreements.

Commissioner Whipple moved the off-site improvements in Stocks

Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Director of Public Works George Wade presented the matter of the
San Francisco Street Crossing to the Board. He stated that
$4,900.00 had been paid by the City. Actual billing as shown

At this time the application of the City of Las Vegas to maintain
a prison farm on property described as N½ of the NE¼ of Section 36,
T20S, R61E, MDB&M was considered by the Board. This application
for a use permit was approved by the Board of Adjustment because
of public need for such an institution and because this section
of the City is relatively undeveloped by housing.

It was recommended that the City Engineer contact the property
owners prior to the public hearing on this use permit to be held
on September 7, 1955, to explain the proposed plans for this
development.

Mr. George Wade presented the tentative map of Knollcrest Estates
Tract No. 1. This tentative map was referred to the Engineering
Department for study and recommendation concerning the street pattern
and proper drainage of the entire area, due to the fact that this
drainage runs almost directly into the Eastwood area. The recommen-
dation of the Planning Commission was that this map be approved
subject to an equitable agreement with the Las Vegas School District.

This tentative map of Knollcrest Estates Tract No. 1 was referred
to the subdivider for correction and resubmission to the Commission

REPEALING ALL ORDINANCES OR PARTS OF ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH was read by
title and referred to Commissioners Sharp and Whipple for recommendation.

City Manager A. H. Kennedy stated that the License Department is holding money from
various application for tavern and package liquor licenses which have not been acted
upon due to the limitation on these licenses. He recommended that the License Depart-
ment be authorized to refund this money.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the money being held in deposit by the License Depart-
ment on applications for limited liquor licenses be refunded.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

parking lot of the State Building and would be 90' x 90'.

Mr. Kennedy was authorized to proceed with this matter and present the proposed lease
with the Girl Scouts at the next regular meeting of the Commission.

City Manager Kennedy presented the matter of a publication compiled by R. E. Barringer
entitled "Building Code Digest", which is represented to be an official booklet on
building and planning ordinances of the City of Las Vegas.

The City Attorney was instructed to prepare a resolution setting forth that this
"Building Code Digest" is not an official document of the City and that notice be
published in the newspapers to this effect. The resolution is as follows:

WHEREAS, it has come to the attention of the Board of City Commissioners that a
Building Code Digest has been issued by R. E. BARRINGER, publisher; compiled and
produced by ADCO PUBLISHING COMPANY, and

WHEREAS, it appears that advertising has been sold therein on the representation that
said booklet is an official publication of the City of Las Vegas; and

WHEREAS, said document is not an official publication of the City and the City assumes
no responsibility for the accuracy of the representations made therein;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the City Clerk cause a public notice to be
published advising the general public that the said Building Code Digest is not an
official city document and is in no way sponsored by the City of Las Vegas nor does
the City assume any responsibility for the matters contained therein.

The Commission was advised by the City Manager that four bids had been received for the
purchase of a flushing truck and auxiliary piece of fire equipment. Mr. Kennedy stated

4)	FOULGER EQUIPMENT CO. - This bid was only on the flushing equipment, and
did not include the truck.

Mr. Kennedy recommended that the second bid of Clark County Wholesale in the total
amount of $9,015.35 be accepted because of the early delivery date and because this
bid was the only one that met the City's specifications.

Commissioner Bunker moved the recommendation of the City Manager be accepted and Bid.

No. 55.15 be awarded to Clark County Wholesale in the amount of $9,015.35.

by the Planning Commission subject to the acquisition by the City of rights-of-way in
accordance with the Master Plan of Streets and Highways.

His Honor asked if there were any objections to this rezoning. Members of the audience
asked if this property was near Tobin and Concord Streets in Vegas Heights. They were
advised that it was not.

Mrs. Robert Lundgren stated that she owns property close to the trailer area, and that
the land in between is undeveloped. She said that she feels that if the variance is
made and it is allocated for trailer space it would decrease the value of her property,
and that other people will not build residences near the trailer park. She further
stated that it will hinder the development of that area, and that the property owners
do not understand why a residential area such as this should be changed.

Mayor Baker asked if there were any other protestants present. The following persons
registered protests of this rezoning: Messrs. Jack Denning, 111 Hassell; Ernie Ringo,
411 Hassell; James Farris, 421 Hassell; Thos. G. Mahoney, 225 Hart; W. S. Walters,

This being the time set for the public hearing of the rezoning from R-4 to C-1 of

had been requested to be present to show cause why this license should not be revoked be-
cause of a reported disturbance at the Swinging Door Saloon on July 14, 1955. He was out
of town at this time, understanding that his presence would not be required until August

31; 1955.

Mr. Harry Claiborne, representing Mr. Jack Gilson, requested that this matter be deferred

Mr. Ben C. Sparks, General Superintendent of Galland Electric Company, appeared before
the Board to show cause why the electrical contractor's license of Galland Electric
Company should not be revoked. The License Department had reported that the Galland
Electric Company, previously licensed at 1600 North 5th Street, North Las Vegas, was
doing business at 2000 E. Fremont Street even though they had been notified that the
maintenance of a construction and storage yard at this location was not permitted.

His Honor asked Mr. Sparks if he were familiar with the complaint filed against him.

Mr. Sparks stated that on July 19, 1955, he had filed an application for a change of
location to 2000 E. Fremont Street. On July 27, he received a letter from the License
Department that he could not operate at that location. He explained to Mr. McDonald
that he could not find a suitable location to make a quick move. The Fire Department
had not approved this license because a construction yard and gasoline storage were
being maintained. On August 5; 1955, Galland Electric Company was requested to appear
before the Board concerning this violation.

Mr. Sjparks stated that they had bought land but that it would take 30 days for the
property to go through escrow and an additional 90 days for them to build.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the Galland Electric Company be allowed 60 days in which
to move their construction yard and outside storage facilities.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Fountain, Sharp and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent: Commissioners Bunker
and Whipple.

Mrs. Robert Lundgren requested information as to when Highland Avenue will be repaired,
due to the fact that school will be started soon and there will be more traffic on that
Street.

Mr. George Wade, City Engineer, advised Mrs. Lundgren that city equipment will be in that
area next week.

City Engineer George Wade requested permission from the Board to proceed with the construc-
tion of South "A" Street by either force account or to negotiate unit price basis, due to the
fact that no bids were received for this construction.

Mr. George Wade stated that Mr. B. M. Jones had requested release of bond on the
B. M. Jones Subdivision as the work has been completed. He further stated that
the work is of very low quality and substandard, and he recommended that the bond be
held until the work is installed properly, or that action be taken to have the
bonding company complete the job.

City Attorney Cannon said that the bonding company had been notified on July 22,

1955, that if the work was not accepted by the City it would have to be let out
for bid.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the recommendation of the City Engineer be accepted
and the bonding company notified that the work on this subdivision is not acceptable.

missioners Fountain, Sharp and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent: Commissioners

Mr. George Wade presented the request of Earl Harke and Opal Cantlon for permission
to use the City of North Las Vegas water and sewer facilities. A letter has been
received from the owners of the property, located at the southwest corner of 25th
and Owens, being 300 x 260 feet which is adjacent to the City of North Las Vegas and
to the County, to receive permission to use water and sewer facilities of the City
of North Las Vegas. The owners maintain that if permission is granted by the City
of Las Vegas, the City of North Las Vegas will approve through their council the
necessary connections. Inasmuch as this property is more than 1,000 feet from a trunk
line, it is possible that such permission could be granted. However, if such per-
mission is granted, it is recommended that it be granted contingent upon this property
connecting to the City of Las Vegas sewer line as soon as sewer lines are within a
specified distance.

Mr. Hartke appeared before the Board at this time. He stated that North Las Vegas
was agreeable to this proposal and he and his partner were willing to connect to
the City of Las Vegas facilities when they are available, provided they are given a
90 day notice.

Commissioner Fountain moved that the application of Earl Hartke and Opal Cantlon
to connect to the North Las Vegas water and sewer facilities be approved on the con-
dition that they enter into an agreement to connect on to the City of Las Vegas
facilities within 90 days, upon notification, when the same are available.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Fountain, Sharp and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent: Commissioners Bunker
and Whipple.

At this time Mr. George Wade made a report on Van Patten Tract Nos. 1 and 2. He re-
quested that Mr. Van Patten be advised to complete Van Patten Tract No. 2, correcting
certain deficiencies enumerated in the City Attorney's report to the Commission on
August 3, 1955.

Mr. Van Patten appeared before the Board and said that he had written a letter in
April regarding conditions in Tract No. 2 but had received no reply from the City.

He was advised that there were 22 deficiencies in this tract enumerated at the last
Board meeting when he was present. He was further advised that the conditions in
Tract No. 1 had been met and that the City had approved conditional release of
this bond.

Commissioner Sharp moved that Mr. Van Patten be given until September 21, 1955 to
correct all deficiencies on Van Patten Tract No. 2, as outlined in the letter of
the City Engineer to Mr. Van Patten, and if not completed by this time that the
bonding company be notified.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote: Com-
missioners Fountain, Sharp and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent: Commissioners
Bunker and Whipple.

circumstances are identical to the application of Dr. E. John Sorenson for similar
use on Charleston and Shadow, which was denied on the grounds that this area is

undoubtedly be rezoned and she would then be involved. She felt that there was
a definite campaign to turn the whole area commercial, and she wished to protest
this or any other change of use in the area.

At this time Mr. Jack Gilson, owner of the Swinging Door Saloon, 111 North 1st Street,
appeared before the Board to show cause why his tavern liquor license should not be
revoked. On July 14, 1955, the Police Department received a report of disturbance
and found Irving Gilson, brother of the owner, in a drunken condition.

Mr. Harry Claiborne and Leo Gilson appeared before the Commission on August 17, 1955
and requested that this matter be continued until this time. Mr. Leo Gilson appeared
with his brother.

His Honor read a report from the Police Department citing the various disturbances in
the Swinging Door Saloon, and asked Mr. Jack Gilson if he were aware of these things.
Mr. Gilson stated that he was only aware of two or three of them, and that he had
defended himself at that time.

He stated that the one specific complaint that they employed B girls was not true,
and that they had even called Mr. Kennedy and informed him that they were doing
without cocktail waitresses to be certain that there would be no further trouble
along this line.

Mr. George Allen, Police Chief, said that Mr. Jack Gilson was fully aware of some
arrests made, and that Mr. Gilson had protested against some of the arrests, stating
that the people were not drunk, but that the Police Department had found them grossly
intoxicated.

His Honor stated that the primary interest of the Board was in the complaint that
liquor was being served to minors, and prostitution.

Mr. Jack Gilson said that he was not able to spend all his time at the Swinging Door
Saloon as he had other interests but that he turned over the business to his brother,
Leo Gilson, when he was away.

Mr. Harry Claiborne said that Irving Gilson had never been an owner of the Swinging
Door Saloon nor a licensee, as reported by the Police Department.

Commissioner Sharp said that he wanted to know how Jack Gilson was going to keep
his brother Irving out of the saloon since he had made the same promise four months
ago and had been unable to do so.

Commissioner Fountain asked how often Irving comes into the Swinging Door Saloon.

He was told that it is almost a daily occurrence but that Irving had given his
promise that he would not come into the Swinging Door Saloon.

His Honor asked Jack Gilson what his business was, other than the operation
of the Swinging Door Saloon. Mr. Gilson said that currently he has the
saloon and manufactures ladies ready to wear in Los Angeles, a business
which he intends to dispose of. He further stated that he would fire any
bartender serving his brother Irving a drink.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the license of the Swinging Door Saloon
be suspended until October 1st to determine whether Mr. Jack Gilson can
devise some method of keeping his brother, Irving Gilson, out of the saloon.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye;
noes, none.

Mr. Jack Gilson stated that closing the Swinging Door Saloon would throw
several men out of work who need their employment, and he would appreciate
it if the Commission would just reverse their action and allow him 30 days
grace in which to keep his brother away from the saloon.

Mr. Dave McCoig suggested that Mr. Gilson put in a deputy for 90 days who
would keep Irving out of the saloon.

At the hour of 9:09 P.M. the meeting recessed, reconvening at 9:30 P.M.
with all members present as of the opening session.

At this time Mr. C. L. Whitchurch of Burns Construction Company and his attorney,

Sam Lionel, appeared before the Commission to show cause why the contractor's
license should not be revoked for gross violations of the Building Code concerning
violations reported to the Commission on August 17, 1955 on Charleston Heights
subdivision, Tract No. 5 (Cliff May Homes), at which time a stop-work order
was issued. Protest letters have been filed by Claude Casey, 5420 Evergreen and
John Tibista, 5416 Evergreen.

Mayor Baker requested Commissioner Sharp to conduct the interrogation concerning
the gross violation of the building code which were submitted to the Board.
Commissioner Sharp stated that numerous signed complaints have been filed by
various property owners in this subdivision.

Commissioner Sharp stated that the Commission was interested in compliance with
the code which he believed the Bums Construction Company was trying to do.

He stated that the Board is not singling out the Burns Construction Company but
are going through all tracts, and that subdividers will be given a reasonable
time to fix the violations. He further stated that if the Burns Construction
Company wanted a list of objections they can be obtained.

Mr. Art Trelease, Supervisor of Building and Safety, stated that the violations
in connection with fireplaces in Charleston Heights Tract No. 5 have been correc-
ted and Tract No. 3 is being checked.

Mr. Jerry Smith, 702 Upton Drive, said that everything so far is being done to
correct violations in his home.

Mr. Whitchurch was asked to appear, or have the Supervisor of Building and Safety
report in 30 days to the Board as to the progress that is being made.
