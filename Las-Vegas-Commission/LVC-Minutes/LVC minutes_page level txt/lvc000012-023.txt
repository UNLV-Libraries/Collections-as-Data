City Attorney Cory stated this resolution would not be considered this
evening as it was his understanding that further consideration was
required.

Commissioner Sharp stated they wanted His Honor Mayor Gragson to have a
copy of this resolution, as well as the Downtown Casino Operators.

City Attorney Cory stated he had a letter which the City had received
from the Housing Authority of the City of Las Vegas, requesting rezoning
of two parcels of property located within the City of Las Vegas, now
owned by the Housing Authority, and which are more particularly described
in the letter above-mentioned, dated December 14, 1959, addressed to
the Board of City Commissioners. He commented that these were the same
two parcels previously identified as "A" and "B" in connection with
correspondence had between the City Attorney's office and the Attorney
General of the State of Nevada, in the course of which the City Attorney's
office endeavored to ascertain the Attorney General's interpretation of
the law. Mr. Cory informed the Board that pursuant to an agreement
between the Housing Authority and the City of Las Vegas, dated March 6,

1958, and on the basis of a lengthy and well considered opinion previously
received from the Attorney General, it was his recommendation that the
request for rezoning be granted.

Commissioner Whipple inquired if it was City Attorney Cory's opinion that
the City would be obligated to rezone.

Mr. Cory replied in the affirmative and went on to state that there has
never been a decision in the Nevada Supreme Court or District Court
involving the legal problem which was raised in connection with the
Housing Authority's prior request (when it was not the owner of the
property) and at that time the City took the position they were not
required to rezone because the Housing Authority was not the owner and
the request would have to be initiated by the then owner of the property
and processed through channels provided by law; that subsequently, there
