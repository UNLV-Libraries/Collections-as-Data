RESOLUTION NO. 114

WHEREAS, it is common knowledge that undeveloped portions of the City of Las Vegas
and the County of Clark have generally become littered with huge quantities of trash,
rubbish, garbage, and other refuse, and

WHEREAS, this indiscriminate use of private and public property creates ill appearance
of a natural resource, hazard to the public health, morals, safety, and general
welfare, and further violates all rules of trespass, and

WHEREAS, the Las Vegas City Dump contributes materially and substantially to these
conditions and casts reflection upon the community in such respect,

NOW, THEREFORE, be it resolved by the Las Vegas-Clark County Joint Planning Commission
that it respectfully urge and request, in the interest of protecting the character,
social advantages, and economic stability of agricultural, residential, commercial,
industrial, and other areas of our community, the Board of Commissioners of the City
of Las Vegas and the County of Clark to initiate ways and means of rectifying and
correcting these conditions.

RESOLUTION NO. 115

WHEREAS, the Board of Supervisors of the City and County of Honolulu, Hawaii,
in regular meeting assembled, adopted a resolution, approved by the Mayor of said
City and County, stating as follows:

WHEREAS, Hawaii has been an integral part of the United
States of America since 1900 under an Organic Act giving it the
status of a Territory; and

WHEREAS, under this 48 years of Territorial status Hawaii
has had only a vestige of the autonomy through the appointment of
its Governor, Judges of its courts and other Territorial officials
by the President of the United States; and

WHEREAS, the people of the Territory of Hawaii have been
qualified and loyal citizens of the United States and have contri-
buted of their services and cooperation in times of peace and war;
and

WHEREAS, the Territory of Hawaii pays more in Federal taxes
that 14 states of the American Union; and

WHEREAS, the Territory of Hawaii is larger in area than
three states of the Union and the population, presently exceeding that
of seven states, is larger than any state when admitted to the Union,
except Oklahoma; and

WHEREAS, the Territory of Hawaii has only one representative
in Congress who has no vote in the House and neither voice nor vote
in the Senate; and

WHEREAS, the Territorial Legislature has petitioned Congress
for statehood 14 times since 1903, and has appropriated funds 11 times
for Congressional investigation; and

WHEREAS, this integral part of the United States exemplifies
its unquestioned loyalty in both world wars in the most recent of which
it suffered physical violence to a vastly greater extent than any other
part of the United States, and

WHEREAS, Hawaii is today asking for Statehood on the highest
moral, political and economic grounds,

Now, Therefore,

BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Supervisors of the City and County
of Honolulu, in regular meeting assembled, that we take this means of
urging upon the Senate of the Congress of the United States of America
