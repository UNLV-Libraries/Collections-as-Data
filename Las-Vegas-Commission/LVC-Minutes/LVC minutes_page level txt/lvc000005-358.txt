 SENATOR PAT MCCARRAN
SENATE OFFICE BUILDING
WASHINGTON, D. C.

PURSUANT TO THE GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OBTAINED DURING THE CONFERENCE
HELD IN YOUR OFFICE THURSDAY 28TH, 1945, WE ARE SUBMITTING THE 

FOLLOWING LETTER AS A SUPPLEMENT TO THE BRIEF PREPARED BY THE CHAMBER OF
COMMERCE OF THIS CITY AND LEFT WITH YOU ON THIS OCCASION.

WE REGRET THAT THE TIME ELEMENT IS SO SHORT THAT WE HAVE NOT HAD AN
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A SATISFACTORY MEETING WITH THE PRINCIPALS OF THE
PUBLIC AIR TRANSPORT CARRIERS WHICH IT WILL BE RECALLED HAVE A PRIOR
PRIME INTEREST IN MCCARRAN FIELD, IN ADDITION TO THE NATURAL SHORT
TIME FACTOR BETWEEN OUR MEETING THERE AND THE DATE SET FOR OUR 

SUBSEQUENT COMMUNICATION OUR RETURN TO LAS VEGAS WAS UNDULY DELAYED DUE
TO AIR LINES BEING GROUNDED IN THE MIDWEST REQUIRING TRAIN TRAVEL WITH
CONSEQUENT ARRIVAL HERE LATE YESTERDAY. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES
WE ARE THEREFORE ABLE ONLY TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING COMMITMENT:

(A)	THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, IS PREPARED TO CONVEY ALL OR
SUCH PART OF MCCARRAN FIELD TO THE WAR DEPARTMENT ARMY AIR FORCES AS
MAY BE DESIRED BY THIS FEDERAL INSTRUMENTALITY FOR A PERMANENT BASE
SUBJECT TO THE CURRENT RESERVATIONS IN THE LEASE BETWEEN THE CITY OF
LAS VEGAS AND THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES.

(B)	IT IS PRESUMED THAT THE CIVIL AERONAUTICS ADMINISTRATION WILL
ASSIST THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS IN AN EFFORT TO OBTAIN A SUITABLE SITE
AND IMPROVEMENTS THEREON FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW MUNICIPAL AIRPORT
SUCH FEDERAL FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION BEING SUBJECT TO PENDING 

LEGISLATION AFFECTING THE CAA. AT SUCH TIME THE PUBLIC CARRIERS WILL BE
IMPORTUNED TO VACATE THE PRESENT MCCARRAN FIELD THUS GIVING EXCLUSIVE
USE OF THE PRESENT FACILITIES FOR MILITARY PURPOSES.

(C)	IN THE EVENT THE WAR DEPARTMENT DESIGNATES AND MAINTAINS THE

LVAAF AS A PERMANENT BASE THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS WILL DILIGENTLY PURSUE
A POLICY SEEKING TO MAKE HOUSING AND ALL ATTRIBUTES FOR LIVING ON
EVEN A MORE ECONOMICAL AND ADEQUATE BASIS FOR THE COMFORT AND HAPPINESS
OF THE PERSONNEL.	

(D)	IT IS FELT CONFIDENT THAT THE IMMEDIATE INTERIM WILL PROVIDE
THE NECESSARY TIME TO HAVE A MEETING OF THE SEVERAL PARTIES OF 

INTEREST AND WORK OUT THE TERMS AND SCHEDULE FOR FINAL CONVEYANCE OF THE
FIELD.

WE BELIEVE SINCERELY THAT THESE NEGOTIATIONS CAN BE MADE THOROUGHLY
ACCEPTABLE TO THE RELATED FEDERAL AGENCIES AND ALL PARTIES OF INTEREST.

WE WILL BE EXCEEDINGLY GRATEFUL IF YOU WILL IMMEDIATELY PLACE THIS
INFORMATION IN THE HANDS OF GENERAL CHAUNCEY AS WE AGREED IT WOULD
REACH WASHINGTON OCTOBER FIFTH. KINDEST REGARDS.

E. W. CRAGIN, MAYOR
CITY OF LAS VEGAS, NEVADA
