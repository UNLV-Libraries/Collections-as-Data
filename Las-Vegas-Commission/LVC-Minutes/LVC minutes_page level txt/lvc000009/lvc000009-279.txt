meeting of the Board.

At this time Mesdames Schmidt, Sobchick and Nicols appeared before the Board concerning a
soot nuisance in the neighborhood of 10th and Bonneville. The City Attorney advised these

might possibly be grounds for a civil action by the complainants.

at this time to request approval of the tentative map. No action was taken by the Board
at this time due to the fact that the sewage disposal problem in this area must be worked
out prior to approval of the subdivision.
