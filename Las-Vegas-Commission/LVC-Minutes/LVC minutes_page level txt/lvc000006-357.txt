VACATION OF "A" STREET	This being the time set for the hearing on the vacation of certain portions of "A" Street

AND FIRST STREET	and First Street, Mayor Cragin asked if there was any one present objecting to the vacations.



Mr. Abe Schur, representing the Teacher Building Company stated that they will not object
to the vacation of the portion of "A" Street if the Klines will first deed to the City the
frontage on Charleston Boulevard needed for the construction of the underpass, and if the
portion of "A" Street to be vacated is restricted in its use so that the Klines cannot
construct any building thereon.

Mayor Cragin stated that the Board at present is only concerned with the vacation of a
portion of "A" Street and not with the deeding to the City of the Charleston frontage, and
that he could see no legal way in which the restrictions Mr. Schur demands can be imposed
upon the vacation of a street.

Mr. Schur said that if the vacation is made without any restrictions in its use, the
Teacher Building Company is objecting.

Mr. George Franklin, Jr., Esq., representing Gus and Martha Kline, stated that they are not
in favor of the vacation if there are any conditions or restrictions imposed on the property
to be vacated.

Mr. Schur again stated that the Teacher Building Company is protesting the vacation of Parcel
No. 1 as described in the notice unless the vacation is made with the restriction that no
buildings will be placed on the portion of the street vacated.

At this time the meeting recessed for twenty minutes at the hour of 4:00 P. M.

The meeting reconvened at the hour of 4:20 P.M. with all members present as of the opening
session.

Mr. Abe Schur stated that the Teacher Building Company objects to the vacation of the portion
of "A" Street for any purpose other than parking, and further objects upon the ground that
if parking were permitted in the fifty-five feet of street remaining after vacation, it would
prevent Teacher Building Company, who is the owner of the property on the west side of the
street, from its normal use. He added that the Teacher Building Company will not protest
if the vacation is made with the restriction that no structure be built on the portion of
the street vacated and that it be used only for parking.

Mayor Cragin said that he could not see how there would be any congestion of truck traffic
traffic in the fifty-five feet remaining in "A" Street after the vacation, when the access
road from which traffic was coming into "A" Street was forty feet wide.
