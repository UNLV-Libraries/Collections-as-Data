Consideration of the Board was given to the application of Earl Alexander to use a
trailer as living quarters in the rear of the building at 1617 Fremont, approved by the
Board of Adjustment

Mr. Franklin Bills stated that the use of the trailer as living quarters was incidental
to its use for display purposes for trailer supplies.

Commissioner Jarrett moved that this application for a variance be denied on the grounds
that it would set a precedent. This motion died for lack of a second.

Commissioner Whipple moved that the application of Earl Alexander for a variance to use
a trailer as living quarters in the rear of the Building at 1617 Fremont be approved,
and the following resolution adopted:

At this time the Board considered the recommendation of the Traffic Commission relative
to the construction of a pedestrian overpass across the Union Pacific Railroad right-of-
way at Bonanza Road.

Mr. George Wade stated that it would cost approximately $15,000.00 to $20,000.00 depending
upon the approach and controls necessary.

Chief Kennedy stated that policing of this area was needed due to the fact that the
railroad company had built a fence around their property and pedestrians were hesitant
to use the walkways provided in the Bonanza Road Underpass.

Discussion was held but no action was taken at this time.

Consideration was given to the petition of property owners of Berkeley Square and surround-
ing area objecting to the proposed construction of a trailer court on Owens Avenue from
F to H Streets and from Owens to Byrnes Avenue.

Mr. Massie Kennard, representing the petitioners, and Mr. Osteguard of Federal Housing
Association appeared before the Board in protest to the construction of the trailer court.
They felt that such a trailer court would cause considerable depreciation to adjoining
property.

Discussion was held and it was decided by the Board that the Federal Housing Association
and the petitioners study the plans of the trailer court before doing anything further.

At this time the Board considered approval of column footings for the American Linen
Supply Company building at 1001 South 1st Street, encroachment on city property.
