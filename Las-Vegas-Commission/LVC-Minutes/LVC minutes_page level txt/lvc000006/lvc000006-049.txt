ing and establishing two municipal swimming pools and incidental facilities thereto; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has determined and does hereby determine on the
basis of the City's experience in the construction of sid swimming pools and on the recommen-
dation of the engineer acting on behalf of the City that by reason of unanticipated increases
in the construction costs, said swimming pools and incidental facilities cannot be completed
by the expenditure of $160,000.00 derived from the sale of said bonds; and

WHEREAS, in order to complete the construction of said swimming pools and incidental
facilities and in order to protect the City's financial investment in the pools now under
construction, it is necessary and for the best interests of the City and its inhabitants that
the City borrow an additional $100,000.00 and issue its bonds in like amount; and

ed by law; and

WHEREAS, in response to said proclamation, no petition was or has been filed asking
for an election on the question of whether or not the proposed ordinance authorizing said
swimming pool bonds should be passed and the Board of Commissioners of Said City is now em-
powered to enact such an ordinance and to issue said swimming pool bonds; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has found and determined and does hereby find
and determine that an emergency exists by reason of the fact that the two swimming pools and
incidental facilities proposed to be acquired with the proceeds of the bonds authorized by
