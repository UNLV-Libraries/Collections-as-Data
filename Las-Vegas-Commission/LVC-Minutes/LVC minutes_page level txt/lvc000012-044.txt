Planning Director Bills presented the application of Louis Gold for
reclassification of a piece of property located at the northwest
corner of 7th and Bridger, from R-4 to C-2, and stated it was the
recommendation of the Planning Department and Planning Commission
that this piece of property, which is located well within the proposed
downtown area and within the proposed Assessment District be rezoned
as requested. Mr. Bills advised the Board the owner of this property
had indicated his approval of the Assessment District procedure; that
it was proposed to construct a hotel type operation on the property,
with the entire ground floor to be devoted to parking, and that the
Planning Department believed it was important, at this stage, that
property owners be encouraged to develop their property. He concluded
by stating full details of the proposed construction would be available
within a month and added there were no protests.

His Honor, Mayor Gragson, inquired if any protestant was present in
the audience. There was no reply.
