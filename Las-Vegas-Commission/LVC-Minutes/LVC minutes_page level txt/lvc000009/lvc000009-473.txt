At this time the Board considered the application of Dr. Rulon Whitehead for a Use Permit
to construct a one-story dental office in the 300 block on Maryland Parkway (Lot 11 and
12, Block 9, Pioneer Heights Addition) in an R-4 zone.

Messrs. Max Kelch, Walter Hunsaker and Leo McNamee, representing Mrs. L. Carrol and Fred
Soly appeared before the Board protesting the granting of this Use Permit in an R-4 zone.

The basis of the protest was that this type of business was not compatible with the apartment
houses located and allowed in this area.

Planning Director Franklin Bills stated that this application for use permit was approved
by the Board of Adjustment subject to adequate off-street parking being provided.

Commissioner Sharp moved the recommendation of the Board of Adjustment be accepted and that
this use permit to construct a one-story dental office in the 300 block on Maryland
Parkway (Lots 11, 12, Block 9, Pioneer Heights Addition) in an R-4 zone be approved subject
to the conditions set forth by the Planning Commission.
