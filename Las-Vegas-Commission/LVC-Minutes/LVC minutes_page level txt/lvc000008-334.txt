The Mayor announced that this was the time and place designated for the Board of
Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, to meet and hear and consider any
suggestions and objections that may be made by parties in interest to the proposed
improvements, or any matters relating thereto, in the proposed Street Improvement
Assessment District No. 100-19 in said City as provided in Emergency Ordinance No.

therein. The Mayor then asked if any written objections, suggestions or comments
concerning said District had been filed in the office of the City Clerk. The City
Clerk answered that no objections, suggestions or comments concerning said District
had been filed in her office prior to said meeting, and she filed a certificate with
the Board of Commissioners to that effect.

The Mayor then publicly asked if anyone desired to make any objection suggestion or
comment, or raise any question, concerning said District.

Mr. Cleveland Schultz, Jr., owner of property on the corner of 8th and Stewart Streets
appeared before the Board to protest the repaving of Stewart Avenue. It was explained
to Mr. Schultz and other property owners in this area, that the proposed improvements
were not to be a complete paving project, but merely seal coat and chips over the
existing pavement. Thereafter, they withdrew their objections to the proposed improvements.

Commissioner Jarrett introduced and moved the adoption of the following emergency ordinance,
which was thereupon read in full, and at length, and is as follows:
