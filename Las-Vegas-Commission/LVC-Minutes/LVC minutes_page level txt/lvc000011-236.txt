Mr. Kennedy stated that in regard to the salary question discussed immediately prior to the
recess, he would like to clarify the point that in the case of Acting Fire Chief Williams
his recommendation of $750.00 per month would be below the first step of the Fire Chief Range
and that he would, therefore, suggest that the Acting Fire Chief be placed on the first
step of the Fire Chief Range.

Commissioner Bunker moved that the City Manager recommendations be approved and the following
salary increases placed in effect:

NAME	DEPARTMENT	STEP SCHEDULE DOLLARS

TREES	City Manager Kennedy stated that the City is receiving a great number of calls to pick up

Trimming and Removal	leaves from the gutters and also to request trimming of trees,

of Leaves

The cost of tree-trimming as people think it should be done would be prohibitive. The present
City policy is that if the City planted the trees, then is our our responsibility to take care of
them; if the people planted them, it is their responsibility. Picking up leaves throughout the
City would also be an expensive service.

Commissioner Sharp proposed that this situation be given some publicity in the newspapers
educating and advising the people how to dispose of this type of trash and just what the 
responsibility of the City is in such cases. It is very probable that the people just don't know
any different.

Mr. Kennedy further stated that the Southern Nevada Disposal, Inc. will pick up limbs that have
been tied into bundles not to exceed 10 feet in length and not to weigh over 100 lbs. Leaves
will be picked up by the disposal company if they are put in a container. This is a part of the
service people are paying for.



The City has a machine for picking up leaves by vacuum for cleaning park areas; however, an
several occasions when the machine was used to serve the general public, the machine was 
frequently damaged by a bottle or can or other objectbeing mixed up in the debris which has caused 
repair bills of as much as $2,000 to the machine. 10-15-58
