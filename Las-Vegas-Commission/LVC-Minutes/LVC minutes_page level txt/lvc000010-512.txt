Las Vegas, Nevada
June 11, 1957

A recessed regular meeting of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas,
Nevada held this 11th day of June, 1957 was called to order at the hour of 4:00 P.M.
by His Honor Mayor Baker with the following members present:

Mayor	C. D. Baker

Commissioner	Wendell Bunker

Commissioner	E. W. Fountain

Commissioner	Reed Whipple

City Manager	A. H. Kennedy

At this time Mr. B. Mahlon Brown, attorney, representing Mr. Caesar Murphy, manager
of the Arthur Murray School of Dance appeared before the Commission. Mr. Brown ex-
plained that Mr. Murphy was contemplating the establishment of a dance hall, pri-
marily for teen-agers, and was negotiating to lease the building located between
15th and l6th on Fremont known as the Vegas Theater. Mr. Brown further stated that
it was their request that the Commission consider an amendment to the existing
ordinance concerning public dance halls in order that Mr. Murphy's proposed enter-
prise could be accomplished. He advised the Commission that Mr. Murphy had consid-
erable experience in this sort of business, and had operated the local Arthur
Murray School of Dance since 1952. Mr. Brown explained that it was proposed to
hold two dances each week from 9:00 P.M. until 12:00 Midnight; one on Thursday and
the other on Saturday. He also stated that the dance hall would be available for
use of private parties and organizations.

The Commission questioned Mr. Murphy on his plans for off-street parking. Mr.
Murphy advised the Board that a great amount of his customers would not be driving
cars, and that was one of his main reasons for choosing this readily accessible
location. He further stated that there was a vacant lot in the area that he felt
certain he could buy or lease to be used as a parking lot.

The matter was taken under advisement by the Commission, to be further considered
at a subsequent meeting.

Election held June 4, 1957 for the election of a Commissioner 2nd Class, a Commis-
