Section 8. That when said bonds have been duly executed and sold, the City
Treasurer of the City of Las Vegas shall deliver them to the lawful purchaser thereof on
receipt of the purchase price. The funds realized from the sale of said bonds shall be
applied solely to the acquisition and establishment of two municipal swimming pools and fac-
ilities incidental thereto, but the purchaser of said bonds shall in no manner be responsi-
ble for the application by said City or any of tis officers of any of the funds derived from
the sale thereof.

Section 9. The interest falling	due on said bonds	on	October 1, 1947 shall be

paid out	of the general fund of said City, or	any other funds that	may be available for such

purpose, and there shall be levied in the year 1947 on all property both real and personal,
subject to taxation within the boundaries of sad City, including the net proceeds of mines,
a tax sufficient to reimburse said fund or funds for such installment of interest, and for the
purpose of creating a fund for the payment of said bonds and the interest thereon, there shall
be levied in the year 1947 and annually thereafter, a sufficient tax on all property, both 

real and personal, subject to taxation within	the boundaries of	the City of Las Vegas, Clark

County, Nevada, including the net proceeds of	mines, sufficient	to	pay the interest on said

bonds and to pay and retire the same as hereinabove provided; and provided further that in
the preparation of the annual appropriation ordinance for the City, the City Council shall
first make proper provision, through the levy of sufficient taxes, for the payment of the
interest on and the retirement of the principal of the bonded indebtedness of the City, and
the amount of money necessary for this purpose, together with the amounts necessary for the
payment of principal of and interest on the other bonded indebtedness of the City, shall be
a first charge against all of the revenue received by said City. In any year in which the
total taxes levied by all overlapping political subdivisions and taxing units in Las Vegas,
Clark County, Nevada, may exceed the limitation of five cents on the dollar imposed by sec-
tion 2 of Article X of the Constitution of the State of Nevada, and it shall become necess-
ary by reason thereof to reduce the levies made in behalf of said City, the reductions so
made shall be in taxes levied for or by such City for purposes other then the payment of its
bonded indebtedness and interest thereon, the taxes levied hereafter for the payment of such
bonded indebtedness, and the interest thereon, shall always enjoy a priority over taxes
levied for or on behalf of such City for any other purposes where reduction is necessary in
order to comply with the limitations of said section 2 of Article X, or with the City Charter
of Las Vegas, Nevada. Such tax shall be levied and collected in the same manner and at the
same time as other taxes are levied and collected, and the proceeds thereof shall be kept by
the County Treasurer in a special fund to be known as the "Swimming Pool Bond Fund, Series
A", which shall be used for no other purpose than the payment of principal and interest as
the same fall due. Such tax shall be levied in the year 1947 and annually thereafter until
all of said bonds, and the interest thereon, shall have been fully paid, satisfied and dis-
charged. Any sums coming due on said bonds at any time when there are on hand from such tax
levy or levies, insufficient funds to pay the same, shall be promptly paid when due from
general funds on hand belonging to the City of Las Vegas, reimbursement to be made to such
general funds in the sums thus advanced when taxes herein provided for shall have been
collected.
