agrees with the obligor and every subsequent holder hereof, that, (a) the delivery of this

the obligor may treat the bearer of this bond as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, and
shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary; (c) the principal of and the interest on

charge to the obligor for the same.
