No action was taken on the bids received for the repair of a Tanker Truck of the Fire
Department recently involved in an accident. City Manager Rounthwaite requested additional
time to negotiate with the Insurance Company on whether or not this Tanker is worth
repairing.

An ordinance entitled:	AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND ORDINANCE NO 233, ALSO KNOWN AS CHAPTER 7

CODE OF THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, 1949, AS AMENDED BY ORDINANCE NO. 522; BY
REGULATING THE ERECTION AND MAINTENANCE OF BILLBOARDS, ELECTRIC AND GASEOUS SIGNS AND
AND OTHER KINDS OF OUTDOOR ADVERTISING SIGNS, PROVIDING FOR THE ISSUANCE OF PERMITS THEREFOR
AND INSPECTIONS THEREOF; FIXING THE FEES FOR PERMITS AND INSPECTIONS THEREOF; REPEALING
ALL ORDINANCES OR PARTS OF ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH, AND PROVIDING PENALTIES
FOR VIOLATIONS; AND PROVIDING FOR OTHER MATTERS PROPERLY RELATED THERETO, was read by
title and referred to Commissioners Whipple and Jarrett for recommendation.

At this time the proposal of the Bank of Nevada to act as a depository for a portion
of the City funds was submitted to the Board for their consideration.

Thereafter Commissioner Jarrett moved that the City transfer the Bond Redemption Fund
account from the First National Bank of Nevada to the Bank of Nevada, 1st and Fremont
Streets.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent:	Commissioner

Bunker.

Mr. William Coulthard, representing Mr. Charles Lasky in his request for issuance of a
building permit to construct an office building on South 5th Street between the American
Legion Property and the Glenn Vegas Motel, appeared before the Board at this time.

Mr. Coulthard stated that his client had secured permission to use the parking lot of
Terrible Herbst, said property being approximately a block away from Mr. Lasky's
proposed building. Mr. Coulthard further stated that in the event this lease should
not go through for some reason or other, that Mr. Hawthorne of the Hawthorne House had
indicated that he would be agreeable to leasing space to Mr. Lasky for parking facilities
for his tenants.

Mr. Thomas Foley representing Mr. Theodore Glenn owner of the Glenn Vegas Motel and Mr.

Russell Taylor on behalf of the American Legion and their tenants reiterated their protests
previously stated at the meeting held July 7th. Messrs. Foley and Taylor did not seem to
feel that the leasing of Terrible Herbst' property would provide the necessary parking
facilities.

Thereafter Commissioner Whipple moved that this matter be held in abeyance until the parties
concerned have an opportunity to work out this problem.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent:	Commissioner

Bunker.

Commissioner Whipple moved that this meeting recess at this time.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Jarrett and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent:	Commissioner Bunker.

Meeting reconvened at the hour of 9:35 P.M. with all members presents as of the opening session
with the exception of George Rounthwaite, City Manager.

Commissioner Sharp moved the bid of the First National Bank of Nevada of an over-all interest
rate of 4.4% for the bond for Assessment District No. 100-25 in the total sum of $162,446.67
be accepted as contained in their bid opened by the Board of Commissioners at a regular
meeting held July 7, 1954.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Jarrett and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Jarrett, Sharp, and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent:	Commissioner Bunker.
