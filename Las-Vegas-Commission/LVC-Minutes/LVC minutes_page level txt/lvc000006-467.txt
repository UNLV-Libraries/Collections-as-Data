SEWER PLANT - New	Commissioner Moore moved that the Mayor be directed to write the following letter to Mr.

Purchase Proposal	Wright Felt, Division Engineer, Bureau of Community Facilities, General Services Admin-

istration in San Francisco, amending the proposal to the Government for the purchase of
the Sewer Plant Project Nev. 26-ll6-F made on June 15, 1949:

Dear Mr. Felt:

My letter of June 15, 1949 to yourself respecting the proposed acquisition by the City of
Las Vegas of the Federally owned sewerage facilities in the City contemplated the issuance
to the Government of certain bonds of the City. You have advised me that the proposal is
acceptable on certain conditions, including the approval of the bonds by the Administrator
of General Services as valid and binding obligations of the City.

The City has had the assistance of Burton and Company of Salt Lake City in handling the
various issues of bonds authorized at the election of May 6, 1947. Burton and Company in
turn employed the firm of Pershing, Bosworth, Dick and Dawson of Denver to prepare the
necessary proceedings and to furnish approving opinions on such bonds. The City has at
all times expected to deliver valid and binding obligations under the proposal of my letter,
and the approving opinion of Pershing. Bosworth, Dick and Dawson will be furnished with the
bonds. I am advised by Mr. Cannon, our City Attorney, that such opinion would necessarily
encompass the purpose for which the bonds are delivered to the government.

The Board of Commissioners, at its meeting today, directed me to amend Paragraphs No. 3
and 4 of the proposal of my letter of June 15 to renegotiate purchase of the sewerage
facilities. In lieu of such paragraphs No. 3 and 4, it is now proposed to deliver to the
Government the remaining $150,000.00 in bonds, plus a cash payment equivalent to the amount
by which the accepted bid for construction of the plant may be less than $550,000.00, in
consideration for the conveyance to the City of all right, title and interest of the
Government in and to the aforesaid sewerage facilities and for the release by the Govern-
ment of all claims or demands it has, or may have, now or hereafter, arising out of any
and all transactions between the Government and the City respecting such sewerage facilities.

The City proposes to deliver bonds in the denomination of $1,000.00 each, maturing in the
amounts and on the dates following:

$4,000.00	July	1,	1950	$4,000.00

$7,000.00	July	1,	1951-56	inclusive	$42,000.00

$8,000.00	July	1,	1957-69	inclusive	$104,000.00

$150,000.00

The City is ready to receive bids for the construction of the new sewerage treatment plant
and to advertise the $200,000.00 of bonds for sale. You are aware of the urgency of the
construction of the sewerage treatment plant, and of the consummation of all action re-
 quired in connection therewith. Consequently we request you prompt action on our proposal,
as amended, and in the completion of the transaction contemplated.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Bunker, Moore, Peccole and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent: Commissioner Whipple.
