use personally to conduct his professional services.

Dr. Howard Zellhoefer

and	At this time, Bill Morse, Attorney representing Dr. Sutherland, came forward to renew the

Dr. Sutherland	offer to lease this property under proposal previously submitted. Mayor Baker made reference

to Dr. Sutherland's letter of November 1, 1958, and the apparent assertion that the Board
of Commissioners had made a commitment to enter into a lease which was not the case.

Mr. Morse agreed and further stated that legally the Board could not do so at that time;
however, they thought the Board was very receptive this summer when they made the proposal.

Dr. Sutherland did spend some money on plans and specifications and also on equipment — the
exact amount he did not know. As for the equipment, the Doctor told him that it could be
utilized over a long period of time. He further stated that his client could not offer a
cash bid because of financial conditions.
