At this time the question of completing the sewage system of the City of Las Vegas came up
for discussion, and it appearing to the Board of City Commissioners that pursuant to an Act of the
Legislature approved March 27, 1931, the City Commissioners were authorized to issue bonds in a sum
not to exceed in the aggregate the sum of $250,000.00 for the purpose of constructing sewage
systems, including disposal plants, within said City and waste mains therefrom:

And it appearing that in pursuance of such authority, the City Commissioners were authorized
to issue bonds in the sum of $160,000.00; that in pursuance thereof, said City Commissioners did
offer to sell and did sell bonds of said City aggregating the sum of $138,000.00, leaving $22,000.00
of said bonds authorized to be sold unsold;

And it appearing that of the bonds sold $10,000.00 thereof represented by bonds numbered
7 to 16 inclusive, were sold to the First State Bank of Las Vegas, Nevada; that the bonds numbered
1 to 6 inclusive and 145 to 160 inclusive, aggregating $22,000.00, were never sold; that bonds
numbered 17 to 144 inclusive, aggregating $128,000.00, were sold to the Nevada Industrial Commiss-
ion;

That of said bonds numbered 1 to 160 inclusive, the first 6 of the same, being unsold, were
due and redeemable on the 1st day of July, 1933, and inasmuch as the same have been due and re-
deemable since July 1, 1933, the said bonds are not now available for sale; that bonds numbered
7 and 8, sold to the First State Bank of Las Vegas, Nevada, aggregating $2,000.00 were redeemed
on the 1st day of July, 1933; bonds numbers 9 to 16 inclusive, aggregating $8,000.00, are redeem-
able on the 1st day of July, 1934, and Bonds Nos. 17 to 24 inclusive, aggregating $8,000.00, are
due and redeemable on July 1st, 1935; and bonds Nos. 25 to 32 inclusive, aggregating $8,000.00,
are due and redeemable July 1, 1936;

That bonds 17 to 24 inclusive, due and redeemable July 1, 1935, and bonds 25 to 32 in-
clusive, aggregating $8,000.00, due and redeemable July 1, 1936, a total of sixteen bonds, were
sold to the Nevada Industrial Commission and are now owned by and held by said Nevada Industrial
Commission;

That the only remaining available bonds that the City may sell the authorized issue are
bonds Nos. 145 to 160 inclusive, aggregating $16,000.00, but in as much as the same are not due
or redeemable until the years 1951 and 1952, owing to the condition of the bond market the same
are difficult to sell; and whereas the Nevada Industrial Commission are willing to exchange bonds
Nos. 17 to 32 inclusive, aggregating $16,000.00, for said bonds Nos. 145 to 160 inclusive, aggre-
gating $16,000.00, so that the City may be in position to offer for sale bonds due and redeemable
during the years 1935 and 1936;

And it appearing to the Board that it would be enabled to complete the now unfinished
sewer system of the City of Las Vegas if it had available approximately $16,000.00; and it further
appearing that it the Board had in its possession bonds Nos. 17 to 32 inclusive, aggregating
$16,000.00, that it could sell and dispose of the same and thus raise the money needed for the
completion of said sewer project;

NOW THEREFORE, on motion duly made seconded and carried, it was,

RESOLVED, that the Mayor and City Clerk of the City of Las Vegas,

Nevada, be and they are hereby authorized to exchange bonds numbered
145 to 160 inclusive, ag regating $16,000.00, which bonds are now
unsold and held by the City of Las Vegas, for bonds numbered 17 to
32 inclusive, aggregating $16,000.00, which bonds were heretofore
sold to and are now held by the Nevada Industrial Commission;

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Mayor and City Clerk of the City of
Las Vegas be and they are hereby authorized to do any and all things
required in order to make such exchange, and to deliver said bonds numbered
145 to 160 inelusive to the Nevada Industrial Commission in exchange
for bonds numbered 17 to 32 inclusive.

The vote on the foregoing resolution was: Commissioners Arnett, German and Down and
His Honor the Mayor voting aye. Noes none.

No further business appearing before the Board at this time the meeting recessed until
Friday the 16th day of February 1934 at the hour of three o'clock P.M.
