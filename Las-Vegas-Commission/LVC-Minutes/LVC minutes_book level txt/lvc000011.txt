DATED:	November 20, 1957

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

	REZONING - Z-8-57 Consideration was given to the application of Art Ham, Jr., representing the Emerson
Emerson Investment Investment Company for the rezoning of Lots 1 through 7; Block 2, Meadows Addition,

Blk 2, Meadows Addn. from R-4 to C-1.

/

Planning Director Bills advised the Commission that the Planning Commission recommended 

that this application be denied. Mr. Bills stated that the Planning Commission felt that this would 

be an unwarranted intrusion of a heavy commercial use into a well developed apartment house area.

	

Mr. Emerson of the Emerson Investment Company was present and advised the Commission that 

his company has a lease with the Hertz U-Drive Company which runs for
more than thirteen years. He stated that Hertz would like to have an additional
fifty feet so that they can construct a $100,000 building on this property. Mr.

Emerson stated that all they actually need at this time is the rezoning of Lots 6
and 7 of Block 2, Meadows Addition.

The matter was taken under advisement for final action later in the meeting.

REZONING - Z-11-57	The Commission considered the application of Albert Lesky for rezoning of Lots 23 and

Albert Lesky	24, Block 8, Meadows Addition from R-4 to C-2. Mr. Bills advised the Board that the

Block 8, Meadows Addn.Planning Commission had denied this application on the basis that this reclassification
	 is not justified and would most certainly result in continued and successive

applications and even greater intrusions into this apartment zone.

His Honor asked if there was anyone present who wished to speak on this application.

No one appeared.

Thereafter Commissioner Sharp moved the recommendation of the Planning Commission
be accepted and the application of Albert Lesky for rezoning of Lots 23 and 24, Block
8, Meadows Addition from R-4 to C-2 be denied.

	Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Hunt & Campbell Campbell for the rezoning of Lot 10,Block 3; South 5th Street Tract No. 1 from R-4
So. 5th Street-Tract to C-2.

No.1

Planning Director Bills advised the Board that the Planning Commission denied this
application on the basis that this type of zoning by lots instead of by areas is
basically inequitable. Mr. Bills stated that the prospective purchaser has indicated
plans to put a hotel employee parking lot and gasolene filling station on this property,
and the Planning Commission does not feel there is any justification for the construction 

of an additional service station in this area.

Mr. Robert Bigelow appeared on behalf of the applicant, and requested approval of this
application.

At the hour of 8:45 P.M. the meeting recessed and reconvened at the hour of 9:05 P.M.

RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has been advised that an application
has been made to the Clark County Planning Commission to reclassify from RE to
C2 the West 660 feet of the North half of the Southwest Quarter of the Southwest
Quarter, Section 25, Township 20 South, Range 6l East, M.D.B. & M., (located on
the east side of 25th Street south of Harris Avenue in Clark County); and

WHEREAS, said property is directly across the street from a fully developed
single family residential property located within the limits of the City of Las
Vegas; and

WHEREAS, in accordance with an approved ordinance formula the City Planning 
Commission and the Board of Commissioners have approved a CC Zone (Shopping
Center) of approximately six acres on the northwest comer of 25th Street and
Bonanza Road, tailored in size to allow the correct amount of neighborhood shopping 
facilities which this neighborhood from Bruce Street to 30th Street and
Washington Avenue to Stewart Avenue can support when fully developed; and

WHEREAS, the addition of ten acres of commercial, zoning in this neighborhood
would inevitably upset this pattern and can only result in harmful effects
upon the residential living values of all properties in this neighborhood; and

WHEREAS, the City Planning Commission and the Board of Commissioners have
recognized the validity of this neighborhood commercial zoning pattern and have

USE PERMIT - U-13-57 	At this time Mr. Leonard Wilson appeared before the Board on behalf of the Calvary 
Calvary Lutheran Church 	Lutheran Church concerning the bond requirement for off-site improvements
	in connection with the Use Permit granted for the construction of the church at

800 North Bruce Street. He stated that when this use permit was approved on
October 16, 1957 the Commission waived the bond requirement, providing the general,
contractor furnish a completion bond covering the installation of off-site improvements. 
Mr. Wilson advised the Board that the contract had been awarded to
the Helgeson Construction Co., and that Mr. Helgeson had requested that in lieu
of posting a completion bond, he be permitted to assign a cash deposit in the
sum of $20,000.00 to the City of Las Vegas and the Calvary Lutheran Church. Mr.
Wilson further stated that this request had been checked with the City Attorney's
office and they had been advised that such a procedure was legally possible.

up a cash bond in the amount of $20,000 to cover the off-site improvements for

BUDGET FOR 1958-1959 	Mayor Baker announced that this was the time set for the public hearing on the 
	proposed Budget of the City of Las Vegas for the fiscal year of 1958-1959.

At this time City Manager Kennedy presented the proposed Budget and a letter 
transmitting the same to the Board of Commissioners; which is as follows:

March 5, 1958

The Honorable Mayor and Board of City Commissioners;

City of Las Vegas;

Las Vegas; Nevada.

Gentlemen:

The Budget for 1958/59 consists of a total amount of $4,887,517.19. This represents 
the total Revenue plus balance carried forward of the City of Las Vegas as
estimated for 1958/59 and the expenses as estimated for 1958/59 amount to the
identical figure of $4,887,517.19. Of this amount; $710,095.07 is for the payment 
of Bonds; Interest and Reserve that are required. This is equal to 34₵  on
the Tax Rate. The largest portion of the balance is for Operating Expenses.

Within the Operating Expenses is $2,677,528.42 that represents salaries paid by
the City of Las Vegas to its employees, representing 535 full time employees and
36 part time employees. The authorized positions of the 1958/59 Budget are 39
less positions than 1957/58. The balance of the money in the Operating Fund for
Operating Expenses is $819,444.14. For Capital Outlay the amount of $680,449.56
represents the expenses that the City will incur for capital projects in all Departments.

Within the Total Budget there is a sale of capital, assets which would be the sale
of land in the amount of $250,000. This is also represented in an expense in
Park and Recreation; with $100,000.00 each; $50,000 to be held if some of the
land is purchased by the State as down payment on the State building; if it is
determined that the City will buy the StateBuilding. Therefore; this amount
should be reduced from the totals of both Revenue and Operation. Therefore;
this amount is a contingent amount on the sale of land; which will be spent only
if the land is sold within the year 1958/59. Therefore; this amount shows both
in Revenue and Expenses as Off-setting Accounts. With this offset on both sides;
Revenue and Expenditures; the actual Budget figures with this reduction leaves a
total of $3,927,422.12 on both sides of the ledger.

The monies representing the Revenue are obtained from sources and in the amounts
as indicated on the Revenue Schedule attached. (See page 2).

The expenses for the Operation of the City is basically in three categories:

1.	Bond Payments:

Principle	$237,000.00

Interest	173,498.00

Reserve Funds Required	299,597.07

TOTAL BOND PAYMENT -	$	710,095.07

2.	Departmental Operating Expense	3,496,972.56

3.	Departmental Capital Outlay	680,449.56

Operating expenses and Capital Outlay by Departments are as indicated on the
Schedule of Departmental Operating Expense attached; (See page 4.). (The 
breakdown by Departments is carried in the copy of the proposed Budget Books; of
which the Mayor and Commissioners each have a copy.

In comparing the 1957/58 Budget and the 1958/59 Budget estimates, it shows that
the estimated available funds are $436,387.13 less than the estimate for 1957/58.

The beginning Fund Balance as shown forwarded this year will be $50,353.67; as in
comparison to the beginning Fund Balance of $344,699.88 in the 1957/58 Budget.
Accounting for this is the reduction of actual funds coming to the City in the
different Revenue accounts than the amount projected in the 1957/58 Budget. The
expenses in 1957/58 were reduced tp compensate for the reduction in Revenue to
the amount that would leave a Balance Forwarded this year of $50,353.67. From
the time of last year's Budget preparation to June 30, 1958 it appears that the
General Fund Revenue will fall short of the estimated by $167,629.19. This shortage
will be more than offset by the reduction in expenditures amounting to $217,982.86,
leaving an estimated Fund Balance Forwarded at the year ending 1957/58 Budget of

$50,353.67.

3-5-58
The 1958/59 Budget, as recommended, is based on the Salary Survey and 
Classification Plan that was recommended by the Public Administration Service for the City
of Las Vegas upon the completion of their survey. The recommendation has been
followed as to classification and pay plan only and to the ability of the City
to finance it. Between now and prior to the First of July the Pay Plan should
be adopted by Ordinance. The Ordinance should make this Pay Plan a full Five
Step Plan with one step per year upon recommendation of the Department Head,
the City Manager and approval of the Commission. Our present plan is a Five
Step Plan but under the method by which it is in operation an employee reaches
the end of his Schedule between three and one-half to four years. At such time
part of the effectiveness of the plan has been lost, as at the end of three and
one-half to four years they have reached the end of their Schedule that they
should not reach until five years, putting them in the position of no place to
go in advancement unless unless they are promoted. The salary survey was 
derived by Public Administration Service by making a comparison of salaries in
private industries, Federal, State, County and City in this area and in similar
areas, and is based on a reasonable pay for classification. Cost of living in
the area was taken into consideration, but this was not a Cost of Living Survey
only, and therefore, should not be interpreted as an overall pay raise for all
City employees, as this will not be a fact. In certain classifications the pay
schedule, as presently paid, comes very close to the recommended. There are 
certain classifications which are presently above that which is recommended for that
classification, which will not mean a reduction in pay to the people in those
classifications, but will mean that they are at their highest point. In implementing 
this into the next year's Budget we financially could not adopt by
schedules and steps straight across the board, but in recommending the method
of adopting it each and every person working for the City of Las Vegas was
studied. We will arrive at the persons being within their schedule and their
classification, the difference being, what step in that schedule they will go to.
This is also based on the fact that this will take place at the date of July
First, which is the new Budget period for 1958/59.

For identical personnel under the old plan, if the new plan were not adopted,
it would cost for total salaries $2,591,546.00. If the plan is adopted as recommended 
by Public Administration Service and implemented into the 1958/59 Budget,
salaries paid by the City of Las Vegas would be $2,677,528.42. Therefore, it
is costing the difference between the old plan and the new plan of $85,982.42,
or 3.32 percent.

In recommending the 1958/59 Budget for adoption by the Mayor and Board of City
Commissioners, we have also taken into consideration the fact that some services
that are not a service to each and every person but have gradually grown over a
period of time, are going to have to be abandoned. To mention a few: People cutting 

their tree branches and throwing them in the parkway or street and expecting
the City to come pick them up. This is a function that is only requested by a
few, but tuns up a cost to the City. The method for this type of rubbing being
hauled away has been set up in the contract with the Southern Nevada Disposal
Service, Inc., who will take care of this service providing it is properly bundled
and handled according to the contract. Secondly; the fact that people rake leaves
out into the street and then call the City to come and pick them up. We did have
a leaf machine that was originally purchased for the purpose of doing this in
the Park, Cemetery and Golf Course and it got around and the cost of operating
this machine gets greater each year. The machine is a suction type and if a pile
of leaves remain in the street for two or three days they wind up with beer 
bottles, beer cans, pieces of rock, concrete, etc., in the pile and when these hit
the workings of the machinery they completely ruin it, which means another repair
bill for the machine. This service is also set forth in the Disposal Service contract,
 which says that the Disposal Company will pick up leaves if they are in
containers such as, boxes, etc., This is the proper way that it should be handled,
for in a container they do not blow all over the area prior to being picked up.

Another service into which we are getting more and more and which is becoming
more and more expensive, is the matter of escorts. We believe that this should
be a fee service, paid for by the people who actually need the escort.

Attached is a breakdown of the recommended Budget showing Budget Summary, General
Fund Source, Operating Expenses, Capital Outlay and Expenses by Departments, each
department showing on its individual sheet an explanation for any major change
within the Department in the 1958/59 Budget.

Respectfully,

s/ A.H. KENNEDY

A.H. KENNEDY

CITY MANAGER

AHK:da

Encls.

Mr. Kennedy briefly explained the charts on the wall of the Council Chambers 
portraying the Budget as presented, and discussed some of the points in his letter
of transmittal as set forth above.

His Honor asked if there were any questions from the audience on the proposed
budget. None were voiced.

Commissioner Bunker then asked if these were all of Mr. Kennedy's recommendations,
and when advised that they were, the Commissioner made the following statement
which he asked be made a part of the record:

"I received permission from the City Manager to discuss with each Department Head
the 1958-59 Budget, during various stages of its preparation. To make a complete
and an analytical study of the Budget would require far more time than I was able
to give this study. My study did bring to light a few items which, in my opinion,
cannot be justified by either the Department Head, the City Manager or the members
of the City Commission. I, for one would be at a complete loss, in some instances,
to make any justification for some of the items that appear in the present budget
under preparation.

3-5-58
This analysis is not to be construed by anyone as a personal affront to any member 
of the administrative staff, Department Head or any member of the Commission.

I am not interested in personalities whatsoever. If anyone should decide to take
offense at what I say or recommend, it will stand as prima facie evidence that
they are selfish, and care little for efficiency or the tax payer of the City of
Las Vegas. Some of these items have existed far too long, and I assume my share
of the responsibility for not speaking up sooner.

1.	It is my recommendation that the position of Assistant to the Mayor at
a salary of $8400 per year be abolished forthwith. I have yet to find
one person who can justify this salary made up of hard tax payers' 
dollars. I have queried several people as to what this position accomplished 
for the City, and all I get is a polite shrug of the shoulders.

2.	The Police Department Budget for the year 58-59 is tremendous, exceeding
a million dollars. The Budget in the past has provided for 90 patrolmen
and 16 sergeants. The maximum number of patrolmen employed during the
past budget year has been 80. I favor providing for 80 patrolmen and
hiring that number. It appears that 80 has taken care of the needs of
the City, and plain cold hard economics dictate that we simply cannot
afford any more. It is my considered opinion that the Police Department
is budgeting for more men than they need to adequately police this City.

I question the necessity or advisability of the use of a Lieutenant and
3 patrolmen at the Police Rehabilitation Farm. It appears to me that
these men's services could be utilized to a greater advantage in active
police work, thereby giving the Taxpayer the maximum return for each
dollar spent. If the Lieutenant at the Rehabilitation Farm is a training 
Officer, then he should be used as a Training Officer and not be allowed 
to waste valuable time on much less important duties. It is my
belief that adequate supervisory help for the Rehabilitation Farm can be
acquired at much less cost than what is presently being provided. In
the interest of economy I would strongly recommend that the position of
Director of Public Safety be abolished and that the salary be reduced
accordingly. The position was created as an experiment, and seemingly
from all concerned, it serves no useful purpose. It is my opinion that
the present Director of Public Safety be employed as a Coordinator of
Civil Defense, and he should be paid for that service.

3. The Department of Street Lighting, commonly known as the Electrical 
Department, presents an amazing situation. We presently have a City 
Electrician at a salary of $625.00 per month, an Electrical Foreman at $476.00
per month, and 7 utility electricians at $341. to $426. This, mind you,
is in addition to an Electrical Engineer in the Engineering Department
and an Electrical Engineer in the Fire Department, presently installing
the Fire Alarm system and necessary equipment. This is a flagrant waste
of Taxpayers' money, and should have been corrected long before this. A
complete reorganization of this Department is absolutely necessary. It
is idle folly to have a Superintendent and a Foreman to supervise 7 men,
especially in view of the fact that able and competent supervisory help
is employed in two other departments of the City. It would be my 
recommendation to the Board that an Electrical Department be established which
would encompass these specific departments; all Electrical, Radio, Street
Lights, Fire Alarm System and Traffic Signals, and in so doing, eliminate
two or three personnel.

4. It is apparent that the position of Cemetery Superintendent can be abolished
without any impairment to that operation. I have been advised that the
foreman at the Cemetery can handle this position along with his other
work. The present employee should be transferred to another department
where his services can be utilized with a greater return to the taxpayer.

5. There need be no provision in the Budget for a Maintenance Superintendent.
The supervisory direction for this Department can be handled by one of
the Engineers.

6. Two Park Guards can be replaced by the Police, making periodic calls at
these stations during the night.

I would like to draw your attention that in these recommendations, a saving of
approximately $40,000.00 in salaries would be enjoyed by the City. These savings
can be accomplished without any loss in efficiency."

Commissioner Bunker further stated that until someone can prove to him that
these recommendations are not in the public interest, he refuses to sign any Budget
that does not cover these recommendations.

Commissioner Whipple stated that he felt these recommendations should be given
consideration.

Commissioner Fountain stated that he agreed with Commissioner Bunker's 
recommendations.

There being no further business to come before the Board at this time, at the hour
of 10:10 P.M. Commissioner Fountain moved this meeting adjourn.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:

Absent:	Commissioner Sharp.

Adjustment had recommended that this application be denied.

Mr. William Singleton, property owner in the area, appeared before the Board
and protested the granting of this use permit. He stated that since the location
of the free-way in this area has not been definitely established it was the feeling

it will result in the free-way being placed further west than the property owners
would like to have it.

Vic Kunkel

Angelo Manzi	1920 Silver Avenue

objected to the granting of this use permit. There were 25 people who stood.

Mr. Herb Jones, representing the applicant appeared before the Board at this time
to request approval of this application. He Stated that the State Highway Department 
had been contacted relative to the location of the free-way, and while it
had not been definitely established, the applicants were relatively sure that
this land would be east of the proposed free-way. Mr. Jones advised the Board
that this proposed construction would cost approximately $1,500,000.00 and it
was estimated that approximately 700 people would be employed.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple announced that it was time for the Commission to open bids
for the Golf Course Sprinkler System, so this matter would be continued after

USE PERMIT - U-6-58	Discussion continued on the application of Dan H. Plunkett and Edward J. Barrick

Plunkett & Barrick	for a use permit at the southwest corner of Oakey Boulevard and Western Avenue,



Commissioner Bunker stated that inasmuch as we are at an impasse it would be
his suggestion that the Board discuss the matter with Otis Wright of the State
Highway Department and put to him a couple of questions:

3-19-58

right-of-way for the proposed free-way?

so the Board can act on this application.

Commissioners Bunker, Fountain; Sharp; and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye;

business to Mel Cooper and associates.

Mr. V. Gray Gubler, representing Mr. Chason appeared at this time and stated
that as it has been explained in Mr. Chason's letter to the Commission, a transaction
 has been worked out whereby it is proposed to sell his stock in the Southern
 Nevada Disposal Service and Transportation Rental Inc. to Mel Cooper, L.L.
LaFortune, John Isola, Alfred Isola, Drs. Kenneth Smith, J.R. McDaniel Jr.,

Grant Lund, and David Arata, Thomas Hughes, Oakley Townsend, Robert Gordon,

Harry Lahr and I.R. Crandall. Mr. Gubler stated that this proposed sale is
contingent upon the approval of the Commission of the City of Las Vegas and
the City of North Las Vegas. He explained that Mr. Chason's decision to sell his
interest in this business is based on the fact that he is not in good health, and
Mr. Gubler presented two letters from local doctors verifying that it is mandatory 
that Mr. Chason not actively participate in business affairs. He advised
that if this transfer is approved the new owners will continue the operation of
the business under the name of the Southern Nevada Disposal Service with the 
intent of dissolving this company at a later date and forming a corporation to
be known as Silver State Disposal Service Inc., at which time they will request
the City to transfer the franchise to this new corporation.

the City has the contract for collection of garbage; Transportation Rentals Inc.
which owns the equipment; and Disposal Investments which owns the land on which
the buildings of the Southern Nevada Disposal Service are located.

and buildings.

2.	$50,000 for Transportation Rentals Inc.

3.	$361,313.84 for Southern Nevada Disposal Service.

Commissioner Sharp moved the proposed sale of Max Chason's stock interest in the

Alfred Isola, Dr. Kenneth Smith, Dr. J.R. McDaniel Jr., Dr. Grant Lund, David
Arata, Thomas Hughes, Oakley Townsend, Robert Gordon, Harry Lahr and I.R. Crandall
be approved.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, Commissioner Bunker and
Fountain.

Commissioner Bunker stated that this Commission by majority vote recommended that
an independent audit be made of the Southern Nevada Disposal Service, and that
audit was in his hands late yesterday afternoon and he had no opportunity to study
said audit; therefore, he was voting against the transfer.

Commissioner Fountain stated that he felt that since a $500,000.00 transaction
is being made this is being handled too hastily, consequently he was voting
against the transfer.

USE PERMIT - (U-8-98)	Consideration was given to the application of John A. Kinnear for a Use Permit to

John A. Kinnear	operate a mail order stamp exchange as a home occupation at 558 Oakey Boulevard

Planning Director Bills advised the Commission that the Board of Zoning Adjustment
recommended approval of this application subject to the License Department checking
 this operation at the end of one year. Mr. Bills further stated that all offsite
 improvements are in and therefore no improvement agreement is required.

5-7-58
Mayor Baker asked if there were any objections to this use permit.

Dr. Alexander Coblentz objected on the grounds that this is a residential 
neighborhood for single family dwellings and he does not wish any commercial 
operations in this area.

The following property owners were present and protested the granting of this use
permit:

Dr. R.C. Wixom	1700	South	6th

William Sellman	1612	South	6th

Harry Allen	1704	South	6th

R.N. Beatty	1608	South	6th

Cletus Mason	1705	South	6th

Mr. Murray Petersen of 807 Bracken appeared in support of Mr. Kinnear's 
application for use permit. He stated that he was not aware of the intent of the 
applicant to operate a commercial enterprise, but that he was solely concerned with
the mail disposition of stamps. He said that Mr. Kinnear spends a great deal of

that the Board of Zoning Adjustment recommended approval of said application subject 
to the limitation of the permit to the present occupant, check by the License
Department and an improvement agreement for the installation of sidewalk.

His Honor announced that two written protests have been received, one from Mr. and
Mrs. Joe Evans at 500 North 9th Street and the other from Mrs. Fern E. Kaercher at
517 North 10th Street.

Mr. Paris Stewart appeared before the Commission and stated that he has owned this
property for a number of years, and until approximately seven years ago lived at
this location. Mr. Stewart stated that several years ago he personally circulated
a petition to request the installation of sidewalks in this area, and at that
time received very few signatures on said petition. He advised that there are no
sidewalks on this side of the block, and he felt that if he were required to install 
a fifty foot strip at this time that it would be more of a detriment and
hazardous than an improvement.

Mr. Stewart further stated that Mrs. Redfeam does alteration work primarily, and
since there will be no signs, or indication of a business other than a sewing
machine he requested approval of the application for use permit. He indicated
that at the present time Mrs. Redfeam is the sole support of her family, and it
is quite necessary that she be allowed to operate as a home occupation.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple asked if anyone else wished to speak on this matter.

Mrs. Joe Evans appeared and stated that she did not object to Mrs. Redfearn using
this location for a dressmaking business, but she did feel that sidewalks should
be installed. She pointed out that there is a church, school and nursery school
in this area, and sidewalks are almost a necessity for pedestrians.

His Honor asked if there was anyone else who wished to comment or object. No one
else appeared.

Commissioner Fountain asked Mr. Stewart the location of the nearest sidewalk in
this area. Mr. Stewart stated that his property was 100 feet from the comer,
and the nearest sidewalk was in the adjacent block.

Commissioner Sharp asked Mr. Stewart if he would be agreeable to the installation
of sidewalks under an improvement or assessment district in this vicinity. Mr.
Stewart stated he would agree to put in a sidewalk at such time as an assessment
district is proposed.

Thereafter Commissioner Bunker moved the appeal by Paris Stewart of the denial of
his application for use permit be upheld and that a Use Permit be granted subject
to the following conditions:

1.	The Use Permit be limited to use by the present tenant, Mrs.
Redfearn.

2.	That a check be made by the License Department in one year

as an Assessment District is proposed.

REZONING (Z-4-58)	The application of the LDS Church and Vegas Linen Supply Inc. for the reclassification 

LDS Church & Vegas	of property located in Section 26, T20S, R61E, from R-4 and C-2 to M-1 and

Linen	R-3, was considered.

Planning Director Bills advised the Commission that this area is bounded by 5th
Street. Bruce Street, Woodlawn Cemetery and Lions Club Park, and the application
was recommended for approval by the Planning Commission on May 27, 1958.

Mr. Bills explained that the general design was worked out through a series of
conferences with the Planning Commission and a committee from the LDS Church, with
information from Anderson Dairy who is located in this area and the Vegas Linen
Supply Co. He stated that there was only one protest to this proposed rezoning at
the Planning Commission, the owner of the Mountain View Trailer Park.

6-4-58
The Planning Director advised the Commission that it was felt that this rezoning
would take care of the proposed development of this area, and would minimize the
number of applications for use permits and variances.

Commissioner Bunker asked what the thinking of the Planning Commission was in
recommending an R-3 in lieu of R-4. Mr. Bills stated that R-4 zoning often encourages 
application for use permits and variances to allow professional offices,
parking lots and the like; on the other hand, R-3 permits limited multiple dwelling
 construction and is a better "buffer" between industrial or commercial uses
and the residential uses.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple asked if there were any protests, comments or questions.
None were voiced.

Commissioner Fountain moved this application for rezoning of the property in

should be required to construct the sidewalks and driveway as recommended.

are in season. He stated that the established firms cannot possibly compete with
these individuals even if they are required to secure a peddlers or solicitors
license. Mr. Rudy further advised that the Agricultural Department has been contacted 
in this regard, but this department advised that they are understaffed
and do not have sufficient employees to enforce the laws which require inspection
of all these trucks.

for securing a peddler or solicitors license and stated that the biggest problem

6-18-98
WHEREAS, these charity drives have all been conducted by worthy groups; and

WHEREAS, the requests to the City have become so numerous that there is hardly
a week goes by that Fremont Street does not have some drive going on with the 
accompanying request that the use of the sidewalk be permitted to assist in the 
collection of donations; and

WHEREAS, the objection to the use of the street is to the sale of tickets
on the public sidewalk, and the use of loudspeakers to attract the attention of
the passerby, and not to the display of the automobile or other valuable prize as
long as not accompanied by ticket sales on the sidewalk and the use of speaking
devices to attract attention; and

WHEREAS, the streets and sidewalks of the City are held in trust for the
use of all the public; and

WHEREAS, the only remedy is to prohibit the use of Fremont Street for the
purpose of conducting ticket sales or the request for donations when accompanied
with the use of the sidewalk to make such sales and when attention is called to
such matters by the use of loud speaking devices; and

WHEREAS, this prohibition should go into effect immediately as far as new
requests are concerned, and in all cases after the conclusion of the present drive
by the City of Hope which ends July 31, 1958;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City of

other valuable prizes to be given away when such requests are accompanied with 
request to conduct ticket sales on the sidewalk and when accompanied by the use of
a loudspeaker or other device to attract attention.

REDUCTION OF LICENSE 	At this time City Manager Kennedy presented the request of Mr. Robert Lee Taylor,

Juke Box operator	owner of Music Systems Inc. for reduction of City license fees on coin operated

juke boxes. Mr. Kennedy advised the Commission that Mr. Taylor has recently 
Music Systems, Inc.	purchased the Ted Patton Music Company and at the time Mr. Taylor applied for 

transfer of this license it was determined that Mr. Patton's company was improperly
classified under the section of the Code which applies to the operation that has
one central location and speakers in the outside locations. Mr. Kennedy explained
that the central music location type of business should pay $20.00 semi-annually
for the first location, and $10.00 semi-annually for each additional location;
while the semi-annual license fee for each juke box is $20.00. He advised the
Board that since Mr. Taylor has approximately 69 juke boxes if he is properly
classified, it will cost him an additional $700.00 semi-annually.

Mr. Herb Jones, representing Mr. Taylor appeared at this time to request that
the Commission consider the reduction of this fee. He advised the Commission that
the average annual license fee in other states for this type of business is $15.00
per machine; in Reno it is $26.00 per annum, as compared to the Las Vegas annual
license fee of $40.00 per machine.

The Commission requested Mr. Jones and Mr. Taylor to make an appointment with City
Manager Kennedy to discuss this matter to see if a solution can be worked out.

OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS	City Manager Kennedy presented an agreement with M.J., Carl, Verm, Paul and Don

Lacy Lane	Christensen relative to the construction of off-site improvements adjacent to 700,

706,710,714 and 716 Lacy Lane. Mr. Kennedy explained that these people agree to
enter into an assessment district to construct all off-site improvements, or to
construct said improvements within two years from the date of the agreement; and
requested authorization for the Mayor to sign this agreement.

Commissioner Bunker moved this recommendation be accepted and the Mayor and Clerk
authorized to sign the agreement with M.J., Christensen et al relative to the offsite 
improvements on Lacy Lane.

6-18-58
Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent:
Commissioner Whipple.

AUDIT OF CITY	City Manager Kennedy advised the Commission that the audit of City accounts for

ACCOUNTS	the fiscal year of 1957-1958 should be started in the near future. The Commission

1957 - 1958	requested that this matter be held over until there is a full Board present.

VARIANCE - (V-6-58)	The City Manager presented the request of Mr. John Replogle concerning the variance 

John Replogle	granted him on June 4, 1958 to build a house on an undersized lot. Mr.

Sidewalk Requirement	Kennedy stated that at the time the Commission approved this application one of

the conditions was that a concrete sidewalk and driveway be installed. Mr.

Kennedy further stated that Mr. Replogle intends to install a driveway, but
is requesting that the Commission grant him permission to omit the sidewalk
since his property is at the last vacant lot on this circle, and the other
houses on this side of the street do not have sidewalks.

Mr. Replogle was present and advised the Board that he would be willing to 
submit a letter to the City indicating that he would be willing to enter into an
assessment or improvement district for the installation of sidewalks in this
area, when the City determines that sidewalks are required.

The Commission requested that Mr. Replogle submit this letter to the City Manager.

(A motion was made on this action later in the meeting) See Page 161

POLICE ATHLETIC LEAGUE 	City Manager Kennedy presented the request from the Police Athletic League to
Soap Box Derby	use East Bonanza Hill for the Soap Box Derby to be held July 26th, 1958 from

2:00 P.M. until 8:00 P.M., and on July 19th between the hours of 2:00 P.M. and
4:00 P.M. for trial runs. Mr. Kennedy stated that the request of this organization 
to place banners across 5th and Fremont Streets is forbidden by State
law. The City Manager recommended that authorization be given to close East
Bonanza Hill, as requested.

Commissioner Fountain moved the request of the Police Athletic League to close
Bonanza Hill on July 19th from 2:00 P.M. until 4:00 P.M. and on July 26th from
2:00 P.M. until 8:00 P.M. be approved.

$1.22 per foot.

ACTING MAYOR	Commissioner Sharp moved that in the absence of Mayor Baker and Mayor Pro Tem

Commissioner Whipple.

VARIANCE (V-6-58)	City Attorney Cannon advised the Commission that the record shows that on June

Sidewalk Requirement	build a dwelling on an undersized lot at 214 Circle Drive, subject to the signing

of an agreement and posting of a performance bond for the installation of
(See Page 159)	a sidewalk; and since the Board has earlier in this meeting acted to delete this

particular condition, a motion should be made to correct the same.

Commissioner Sharp moved the action of the Commission on June 4, 1958 relative
to the granting of Variance V-6-58 be corrected to show that this variance is
granted subject to the installation of a driveway and on the further condition
that Mr. Replogle file a letter that Mr. Replogle file a letter with the City

sidewalks are required.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent:
Commissioner Whipple.

PAY PLAN	Commissioner Bunker stated that he felt that the proposed pay plan should be 

discussed before the first of July, and he personally felt that the City cannot wait
any longer.

City Manager Kennedy stated that at the time of the adoption of the 1958-59 
Fiscal year Budget funds had been included to adopt the recommended Pay Plan within
the limits of the available funds. The total cost of adopting the complete 
recommendations would have been approximately $200,000.00. The recommendations were
provided for in the Budget on a modified basis which would cost approximately
$80,000 the first year.

The recommended Pay Plan is a 5 step plan, the same as the existing Pay Plan. In
the present Pay Plan an employee is hired on the first step and is eligible for
the second step at the end of 6 months, and eligible for the third, fourth and
fifth steps one year after going to the second step. In the recommended Pay
Plan, employees will be hired at the first step and became eligible for the 
second, third, fourth and fifth steps after service of one year in each step.

Generally, personnel have been placed in the recommended schedules at that salary
which is either equal, to or nearest above the salary received under the present
schedules. Personnel presently at a salary greater than the maximum of the 
recommended salary are not reduced in salary but held at their present salary. During
the Fiscal year 1958-59 personnel will generally be eligible for a subsequent
step increase depending on their service in grade under the new service time 
requirements of one year's service between eligibility for each step of the plan.
Certain arbitrary decisions had to be made that do not quite correspond to general
policy; however, wherever this had to be done it was done in the interest of
equity and consistent with the problem of availability of funds.

Mr. Kennedy pointed out that in regard to the foregoing the majority of the 
employees are receiving a salary increase; however, some employees will be frozen
at the amount they are making because their present salary is greater than the
top of the recommended schedule; some employees will initially receive the same
salary as they are now making because their amount of service is such that they
are not initially entitled to an increase, and that in a few instances salaries
will be slightly reduced due to a change in the hours worked.

In regard to the question of the Police Department and Fire Department Schedules,
the Public Administration Service recommendation on the Police Department was as
follows:

Position	Schedule

Police Chief	42

Asst. Chief	     36

Lieutenant	33

Sergeant	30

Patrolman	27

Public Service Administration recommendation on the Fire Department was as 
follows:

Position	Schedule

Fire Chief	40

Asst. Chief	34

Battalion Chief	32

Captain	29

Engineer	27

Fireman	26

The question of raising the Fire Department Schedules as recommended in the 
Survey so that the Fire positions would be essentially the same as the Police 
Department positions, would result in the following schedule:

Position	Schedule

Chief	42

Asst. Chief	36

Battalion Chief	33

Captain	30

Engineer	28

Fireman	27

6-18-58
The first years' cost of adopting this schedule is approximately $8,000 which
would mean that to place the Fire personnel in this schedule would cost 
approximately $8,000 above that which was budgeted for the year 1958.59. In the second
and third year, or such time as personnel might reach their maximum of this 
schedule, the total possible annual cost of this schedule above the survey schedule
would be approximately $28,692.00.

Indiscussion with the Fire Department personnel, they made an additional request
that Engineer, Captain and Battalion Chief positions be placed on higher schedules
so that the Fire Department schedules would be as follows:

Position	Schedule

Chief	42

Asst. Chief	36

Battalion Chief	34

Captain	32

Engineer	29

	Fireman	27

The first years' cost of making this second adjustment which would change engineers,
captains and battalion chiefs, would be an additional $2400.00. The additional
cost in two or three years, or when all personnel might reach the top of their
schedule would be approximately $20,280.00 per year.

Mr. Kennedy continued that in trying to figure the problem of which schedule
should be used and what to compare them to, one way would be: Chief to Chief,

Assistant Chief to Assistant Chief, Patrolman to Fireman; this is not the great
problem. The Fire Engineer has no equal in the Police Department. You compare
them, Fire Captain to Police Sergeant, Battalion Chief to Lieutenant, with the
Fire Engineer coming up one step above the Fireman. The Firemen's Benefits 
Association brought up the question of the Battalion Chief compared to a Captain in the
Police Department, when you appoint one, and leaving the comparison to the Police
Sergeant and the Fire Engineer. But then you reach a point of creating new 
positions which you do not need, which you will have to deal with when the time
comes for creating those positions.

Mayor Baker asked the City Manager what his recommendation was.

Mr. Kennedy answered the Mayor by saying that he would like to finish out before
he made any recommendation.

The Mayor asked if the City Manager's recommendation was within the personnel, and
if it can be taken care of as projected? Mr. Kennedy answered yes.

Mayor Baker then asked if the time and call in these two departments was commensurate.

City Manager Kennedy stated that it is hard to try to compare back and forth since
they are two different functions. He stated that the time off and call to duty
along with vacations are about the same; but it would have to be determined whether
to stop outside work in the Fire Department.

Commissioner Fountain asked if outside work wasn't also permitted in the Police 
Department.

Police Chief Sheffer answered that outside work was permitted only on vacations or
in case of emergency, and then only permitted four hours a day.

Mayor Baker and Commissioner Fountain again asked the City Manager for his 
recommendation.

City Manager Kennedy stated that if the Commission has conceded to bring the 
Police and Fire Departments up to the same schedule, then his recommendation was
as follows: 27-27-30-33-36-42.

Commissioner Bunker then stated that this makes them lineup this way:

Patrolman	27	Fireman

- 0 -	28	Fire Engineer

Police Sergeant	30	Captain

Lieutenant	33	Battalion Chief

Asst. Chief	36	Asst. Chief

Chief	42	Chief

Captain Wimberly of the Fire Department was present at this time and stated that
two years ago the Police and Fire Departments were on the same schedule; Fireman
to Patrolman; Engineer to Sgt; Captain to Lts; and Assistant Chiefs and Chiefs.

Commissioner Bunker stated that he felt this should have been studied long before
this by the Commission. That it should have been gone into entirely before making
a decision; it is a complex problem, and the whole plan should be studied, along
with several other things the City needs to do. Commissioner Bunker continued
that there appears to be the possibility of a tie vote, and he felt the 
Commission should meet between now and the first of July and make a decision. 
Commissioner Sharp agreed there should be a meeting.

Commissioner Bunker further stated that this matter should be studied so the 
members of the Commission would be familiar with it.

Mayor Baker stated that it was his opinion that the recommendation of the City
Manager should be adopted.

Commissioner Bunker indicated that he was not ready to vote.

Mayor Baker stated there might have to be a compromise and the two positions in
question adjusted since other employees are being held up if the Commission is
not ready to adopt the Pay Plan.

6-18-58
Captain Larsen of the Fire Department was present and stated that there is a 
problem on the recommendation of the City Manager as it pertains to the Fire 
Department. He indicated they definitely did not go along with this recommendation.

He advised that there were various meetings with the City Manager and the 
compromise has been explained to the Commission this evening. He further stated that
they felt they have given their position, and are still below the Police 
Department and do not see how they can be expected to back down and accept the City
Manager's recommendation.

At the hour of 9:35 P.M. Commissioner Sharp moved this meeting adjourn.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent:
Commissioner Whipple.

who wished to speak on this matter, and asked that those who are in favor of the
proposed change speak first, and those who are protesting speak after.

Mr. Henry Bridgeman, Chairman of the Highway Committee of the Chamber of Commerce
was the first to speak in favor of this change. Mr. Bridgeman explained the 
background for the reason for requesting this change, enumerated the numerous 
meetings held with the respective Planning Commissions and Commissions of Clark County,
North Las Vegas and Las Vegas. Mr. Bridgeman further stated that the original
request was that the change be made only on Fifth Street, designating the street
Las Vegas Boulevard North and Las Vegas Boulevard South, using Fremont Street as
the intersection point. He advised that subsequent to this original 
determination, a number of the businessmen on Main Street had requested that Main Street
also be changed to Las Vegas Boulevard, which resulted in the compromise 
resolution that is being considered by the Board of Commissioners at this meeting.

At the hour of 7:40 P.M. City Attorney Cannon arrived at the meeting.

6-30-58	7-2-58
Mr. Bridgeman urged the Commission to favorably consider this request and advised
that the City of North Las Vegas has already gone on record as approving the
change of the name of Main Street in their City to Las Vegas Boulevard.

Mr. Tim Nolner appeared before the Commission in favor of this proposed change.
Mr. Nolner stated that the committee from the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce has
been on record as favoring the change of 5th Street from the beginning, and the
and the inclusion of Main Street is a compromise to those requesting this change.
He asked the Commission to consider all factors and urged the change of name.

Mr. A.L. Childs spoke next and stated that he did not feel there should be any
distinction between the renaming of 5th Street and Main Street. He said he felt
the major part of the economy of our City is dependent upon hotels and motels,
and the owners of these businesses should have preferential right to bring their
requests before the Commission. He advised that he favored the renaming of both
5th and Main Streets to Las Vegas Boulevard.

Mr. J.W. Conroy appeared next in favor of the proposed change of street name. He
urged favorable consideration and asked that if the Commission is not in favor
of renaming both 5th and Main Streets, that the whole matter not be dropped,
since he felt that it would be of great benefit to the community to have a Las
Vegas Boulevard. Mr. Conroy indicated that he was in favor of the renaming of
5th Street, or both Main and 5th, but he urged favorable consideration of the
original request for the renaming of 5th Street.

Mr. M. Brandolini, owner of the Monte Carlo Auto Court on South Main Street 
appeared and requested that the Commission consider the renaming of Main Street to
Las Vegas Boulevard. Mr. Brandolini stated that if it was good for the community
to rename 5th Street to Las Vegas Boulevard, he felt it was equally important
to give the property owners on Main Street the same benefit.

Mr. Reed Wittwer appeared next, and advised the Commission that he was a property
owner on both North and South Main. He stated that Main Street is losing business
and urged the Commission to favorably consider the renaming of Main Street to
Las Vegas Boulevard in order to protect the investments of these property owners.

Mr. Ray Maki, part owner of the Rancho Anita Motel on 5th Street stated that he
did not feel the renaming of Main Street was as important as the renaming of 5th
Street. He said that the tourists coming into Las Vegas have to be encouraged,
and he felt the renaming of 5th Street would be important in bringing traffics
into Las Vegas off the proposed new freeway.

Mr. Abe Snider, appeared next and stated that his business is located in the
County, and urged the Commission to favorably consider this renaming on the basis
of the publicity that would result from the name of "Las Vegas Boulevard".

At this time Commissioner Sharp arrived at the meeting.

The Commission next considered those present who wished to protest the renaming
of 5th and Main Streets.

Mr. David Katzman, businessman on South Main Street appeared in protest to the 
renaming of Main Street, and presented a petition of protest signed by approximately
34 merchants and property owners. Mr. Katzman said he was objecting on the basis
of the confusion that would result from the designations South, Southeast, Northeast, 
Southwest and Northwest; the cost of this change of street name to the
businessman; and further that he did not feel that the tourist would by-pass
Las Vegas, since there is very little to attract them between Baker and St.

George other than Las Vegas.

Mr. Bill Roesselet of 2400 Sherman Place appeared in protest. Mr. Roesselet 
advised the Commission that he is a property owner on both 5th and Main Streets
and he felt that neither of the names of the streets should be changed.

Mr. Herb Tobman, owner of a business on South Main Street, presented the 
Commission with another petition containing approximately 34 protestants to the change
of the name of Main Street. Mr. Tobman stated that the existing name suited
the merchants in this area, and they did not care what other changes the 
Commission made, so long as the name of Main Street remained unchanged.

Mrs. Augusta Schouten appeared in protest to the change of name of Main and 5th
Streets. She advised that she had also filed a written protest and indicated
that she not only thought the new proposed names were too vague, too long and
too hard to remember, but she thought the expense involved was unnecessary.

Mr. Sid Sheppard, owner of a business on South Main Street spoke next in protest
to the proposed change of name. Mr. Sheppard advised that he has signed a 
petition along with 67 other businessmen on Main Street, who want to keep the name
unchanged.

Mr. Loren Ronnow, representing the Clark County Wholesale Mercantile on South
Main Street spoke next in protest to the change, and stated that he wanted the
name of Main Street left as it is.

Mr. Jack Underwood spoke in protest to the change of name, and stated that he
thought there would be too much confusion in street designations.

Mr. Otto Westlake also spoke in protest to the proposed change. Mr. Westlake
stated that he owns property on South Main Street that is presently designated
1111 South Main. He further stated that if the proposed change is approved
that he felt it would be confusing, since he understands the new designation will
be 1111 Las Vegas Boulevard Southwest. He indicated that he was primarily 
concerned in protesting the change of the name of Main Street, not Fifth Street.

Mrs. Dale Schofield, a home engineer, spoke in protest to the renaming of 5th
Street and Main Street.

7-2-58
Mr. George Banian was the last protestant to speak before the Commission. Mr. Boman
indicated that while he did not own property on Main Street or 5th Street, he works
on South Main, and he cannot see where the change of the name of the street will
be of any benefit. He stated that it would add, in his opinion, to the confusion
of street addresses.

Mr. A.L. Childs and Mr. Henry Bridgeman again spoke on behalf of the proposed
change.

Mayor Pro Tem asked if there was anyone else who wished to be heard on this 
matter, if not he would entertain a motion, since there were other items on the
agenda to be taken care of by the Commission.

Commissioner Fountain stated that he felt that this is a serious issue, and since
there was not a full Board he moved that the proposed change of the name of Fifth
and Main Streets be taken under advisement.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye;
noes, none. Absent:	Mayor Baker.

LOUISIANA CLUB -	At this time Mr. Ralph Denton, attorney, and Mr. Z. Louie of the Louisiana Club,

Poker Table Operation	1322 North F Street, were present to discuss the operation of the poker games at

this Club.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple advised Mr. Louie and his attorney that the Commission has
received reports from the Police Department that on several occasions Mr. Louie
has been advised of violations occurring and has received instructions from the
Police Department which have not been followed. His Honor stated that the 
Commission wanted to know why Mr. Louis has not followed the instructions given him.

Police Chief Sheffer advised the Commission that an investigation of this Club
has disclosed that on June 20, 1958 a George Duncan was operating the Poker game
on a 50-50 basis. Chief Sheffer stated that Mr. Louie was advised that this was
in violation of the State and City gambling regulations and requested to stop
operation. The Chief further reported that the next day when the Club was checked,
it was found that a Mr. Williams was operating the Poker game under the same 
conditions.

Mr. Louie advised the Commission that he did not understand at the time that this
was a violation, but he did understand the regulations now and would not permit
the recurrance of this incident.

The Commission advised Mr. Louie to thoroughly familiarize himself with the 
regulations concerning the operation of a gaming casino and not permit any future
violations.

has a long history of arrests, and the granting of a taxicab license would not
be consistent with the protection of the public welfare, as the business of a

of Bayne Simpson for a license for one taxicab, doing business as Desert Cab Company, 
313½ North Main Street, be denied.

Assistant Chief	36

Battalion Chief	34

Captain	32

Engineer	29

Fireman	27

7-2-58
2. Police Department:

Position	Schedule

Police Chief	42

Assistant Chief	36

Lieutenant	34

Sergeant	31

Patrolman	27

Mr. Kennedy stated the Pay Plan, as recommended allows for the meritorious 
increases for the fiscal year 1958-1959, based on length of service in position.

He explained there are 41 less people authorized in the Budget for 1958-59 on a
full time basis than were authorized in the Budget for the fiscal year of 1957-
1958. He stated that at the present time the City has less than the 533 employees
authorized, so adoption of this Plan will not mean that any person will be relieved
of his job with the City. He further explained that a check of the total cost of
the proposed Pay Plan with the Budget for 1958-59 shows that it can be financially
taken care of within the Budget.

Mr. Kennedy advised that there was one other think that he did not include in his
letter of recommendation - an explanation that the Pay Plan, as recommended, is a
full four year step program.

Commissioner Fountain asked the City Manager if he had talked to Mayor Baker by
telephone on this recommendation, and if the Mayor agreed with this change in
the Police and Fire Departments pay schedule.

Mr. Kennedy stated that he did discuss this matter with Mayor Baker on Tuesday,

July 1st, and advised him of his recommendation on the Pay Plan and asked the
Mayor if he had any objections or suggested changes, and he further advised the
Mayor he would like to request the Commission to approve this recommendation on
July 2nd. Mr. Kennedy stated that the Mayor had indicated he had no objection
to the recommendation, nor to the matter being placed on the agenda for the
regular meeting of July 2nd for Board action.

The City Manager reported on the Classification study, and stated that it is his
recommendation that it be adopted as presented and amended. He reported that the
Classification Plan provides a job description and classification for the different
types of employment within the City. He explained that it also changes the names
of the existing classifications so that they will coincide with the names used in
private industry and other public employment, thereby making it easier for the City
to secure information from the outside relative to pay and other benefits given an
employee doing a particular type of work. He continued that the Classification
Plan does away with 41 descriptions previously used by combining identical and
similar work under one classification, and as nearly as possible doing away with
descriptions for one person only.

Mr. Kennedy requested that the Pay Plan and Classification Plan as recommended, be
approved, and presented a proposed resolution for adoption.

Commissioner Fountain moved the Pay Plan and Classification Plan, as recommended
by the City Manager, be approved, and the following resolution as amended, be
adopted:

RESOLUTION

classifications of positions in the City service to be made; and

received the City Commission can determine what changes, if any, they desire, after which

considered the application of Vail Pittman for variance to extend a carport 6' beyond the
existant front building line at 1817 Walnut Street (Lots 27 and 28, Block 2, Boulder
Dam Homesite #1) in and R-1 zone; and

The Board having considered the recommendation of the Board of Zoning Adjustment approving
this application subject to the signing of an agreement to enter into any future assessment
or improvement district for sidewalk installation;

8-6-58
NOW, THEREFORE, it is the decision of this Board that this application for variance be approved.

Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

John Walker	yard from 25 feet to 14'5" at 559 Griffith Avenue (Lot 6, Block 4, Desert Park Tract No. 3) in an

R-1 zone. The Commission was advised that the Board of Zoning Adjustment recommended this
Approved	application be approved.

His Honor asked if there were any objections to the granting of this application. None were
voiced or filed.

Commissioner Fountain moved this application be approved and the following resolution adopted:

BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada at a regular
meeting held on the 6th day of August, 1958 having considered the application of John Walker
for variance to reduce the required rear yard from 25 feet to 14'5" at 559 Griffith Avenue, (Lot
6, Block 4, Desert Park Tract No. 3) in an R-1 zone; and

The Board having considered the recommendation of the Board of Zoning Adjustment approving this
application;

NOW, THEREFORE, it is the decision of this Board that the application of John Walker for variance
be approved.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Fountain, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Commissioner Sharp passed
his vote.

VARIANCE (V-8-58)	The Commission considered the application of Melvin Campbell for variance to utilize a portion of

Melvin Campbell	the required rear yard for patio and equipment shelter at 1700 South 14th Street, between St. Jude

and St. Joseph Circles (Lots 21 and part of Lot 22, Block 3; Marycrest Estates) in an R-1 zone.

Planning Director Bills advised that denial was recommended by the Board of Adjustment on the
basis that the rear yard is already less that that required by ordinance; an addition has been
made without a building permit to the house extending completely over the side lot line; and
because of the written protest of the legal owner of the property there appears to be doubt as to
the right of the applicant to make application.

Mr. John Mowbray, attorney for the Kax Corporation appeared and advised the Commission that they
wished to object to the granting of this variance.

Mr. Melvin Campbell appeared at this time and explained to the Commission that this property had
been purchased from the Kax Corporation, only partially completed, and he could show documents
that proved that he is the legal owner of the premises at this time. He stated that he and his wife
had constructed a fence, a grape arbor that is covered with numerous improvements to protect
themselves and their property from heat, wind and dust. He further stated that when he had
discovered that there was insufficient property in the backyard, he had contacted Mr. Mowbray
and purchased all land available, which was still insufficient.

He explained that he was unaware that it was necessary for him to have a building permit to build
a grape arbor, and that was his reason for this violation.

Mr. Campbell introduced his neighbors who are supporting his request for variance, Messrs. Ralph
Forbes, Stupar and Santam.

Further discussion was had on this matter, and at the hour of 8:45 P.M. the Mayor declared a
recess. The meeting reconvened at the hour of 9:00 P.M. with all members present as of the
opening session.

Commissioner Fountain moved the application of Melvin Campbell for variance be held in abeyance
for further study.

Dr. Darryl N. Leavitt	located on the southside of West Charleston Boulevard between Desert Lane and Highland Drive,

from R-1 and R-4 to C-2.

Planning Director Bills advised this had been recommended for denial by the Planning Commission on
the grounds that this property has residential development on three sides, and a further extension
of commercial zoning along West Charleston would be contrary to good planning. He stated that
one protest was received from the Presbyterian Church.

Commissioner Bunker moved this application be held in abeyance until completion of the Master
Plan of Land Use.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners Bunker,

Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

responsibility therefore "to complete, extend, add to, repair or otherwise improve any works or
improvements or property acquired" solely and squarely upon the Board of Directors, making
it their duty and responsibility to service new areas with a sufficient, close, supply
of water with sufficient pressure to meet the needs of the public; and

WHEREAS, the Director of Planning received a communication dated August 22, 1958,
signed by the Chief Engineer and General Manager of the Water District that a water supply
is not available to service Greater Las Vegas Addition No. 3 "since there is no capacity
remaining after present commitments in either the 12-inch line on 25th Street or the
12-inch line on Foremaster. The nearest point at which an adequate supply is available is
at the intersection of 25th and Charleston"; and

WHEREAS, since the date of August 22, 1958, the newspapers have carried stories
that the District now may have a plan which will guarantee water service to Greater Las
Vegas No. 3; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas is greatly concerned
as to whether the District has adequately planned for the prospective development of the
City of Las Vegas as a whole; and

WHEREAS, in the opinion of the Board of Commissioners it is essential that plans
must be made immediately for the expansion of water distribution facilities to adequately
provide for the development and expansion of the City of Las Vegas; and

WHEREAS, if such plans are not adopted with all possible speed it would be a
drastic blow to the development and expansion of the City not only by curtailing the
construction of badly needed housing, but also by preventing the employment of many
citizens of the City in the home construction industry; and

WHEREAS, if the City of Las Vegas is to continue to grow, adequate water service
to all areas within its boundaries is a necessity; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners, in the interest of the welfare of the
citizens of the City of Las Vegas, feels that it should be advised of the plans of the

9-3-58
Water District as to future policy and direction of expansion of the District to meet the needs
of the ever growing population of Las Vegas.

NOW; THEREFORE; BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas;
at a regular meeting thereof held on the 3rd day of September; 1958, that the Las Vegas Valley
Water District; through its Board of Directors; immediately advise the City of Las Vegas of its
plans to assure an adequate domestic water supply to those areas in the City of Las Vegas where

disappointed over the Board of Zoning Adjustment's recommendation for denial she realized
that if the surrounding property was to be essentially R-1, it would be to her advantage for
her property to be compatible and that she had already sought a different location for her
poultry and deer processing plant.

Fremont to Charleston	Las Vegas, Nevada

September 17, 1958

Honorable C. D. Baker, Mayor
City of Las Vegas and
Honorable Board of City Commissioners
of the City of Las Vegas

Gentlemen:

Please be advised that we, the undersigned, are the legal owners of the
real property located at 1800 East Fremont Street, Las Vegas, Nevada,
commonly known as the Clark Inn Motel, and of the 300 feet of unimproved
land lying directly south of said property.

It has just come to our attention that engineering equipment of the City
of Las Vegas is presently trespassing upon the westerly 60 feet of the
above described property by attempting to grade and pave a 60 foot roadway
across the same.

Please be advised that we object to these activities upon the part of
agents or employees of the City, and demand that they be discontinued
immediately.

If the City should proceed with the grading and paving of this area,
which is the property of the undersigned, and has never been dedicated to
the City, for street purposes, or otherwise, the City will be acting at
its peril.

Very truly yours,

s/ Orvy Clark___________ 

gc	s/ Adeline E. Clark

Mr. Kennedy advised the Board that the street was in the process of being relaid when the
letter was presented to the City and the matter was called to our attention, at which time
all work was stopped. Preliminary investigation has indicated a title search and survey is
necessary to clarify the situation. Once we have all of the information, which should be
early next week, a full report will be made to the Board.

The letter was acknowledged, to be received and filed.	

PETITION FOR ASSESSMENT The Board considered the petition signed by Philip H. Empey, Julia S. Huffey and Jerome D.

DISTRICT	Mack for creation of an Assessment District for the installation of street, curb and gutters

on Bracken Avenue between 6th and 7th Streets.

Mr. Kennedy advised that the property owners in this block have been trying to get these
improvements for quite some time and that it would be impractical to attempt to create an
assessment district on a one-block street as the cost would probably be prohibitive.

The matter was referred to the City Manager and the Director of Public Works for computation
of cost, the property owners to be notified of the estimated cost and report back to the
Board of City Commissioners.

CHANGE OF NAME	Mr. Kennedy reported	to the Board that he had been in contact with Grant Stewart, President

Fifth Street to	of the Chamber of Commerce, and discussed with him the renaming of Fifth Street to Las Vegas

Las Vegas Blvd.	Boulevard and the possibility of placing the name change into effect July 1, 1959 so as to

give all of the persons involved sufficient advance notice of the change.

Mr. Cedric Olson of the Chamber of Commerce appeared at the request of Grant Stewart,
President of the Chamber of Commerce to emphasize the fact that they felt the change would

VARIANCE (V-14-58)	The Commission again considered the application of Robert O'Brien to construct and operate

a maternity hospital on the north side of West Charleston between Brush & Upland, legally
Robert O'Brien	described as Government Lot 55, Section 36, T20S, R61E, in an R-1 zone.

Maternity Hospital

Mr. Bills, Director of Planning, stated that under the present ordinance a hospital is allowable

Referred back to	in a Commercial Zone. If this were a publicly-owned hospital, as the majority in the United

Planning	States are, it would be possible to grant a use permit as a public use. The effect on the

area would not appear to be much different in the case of a privately owned hospital than one
owned by the public.

Mr. Ed Hendricks of Moffitt & Hendricks Architects spoke for his client, Robert O'Brien, and
requested deferral of the application until the Planning Commission has the opportunity to make
a further study and recommendation as to zoning changes for hospitals.

The City Clerk stated that three protests had been received by the Planning Commission and
that two other protests had been received and filed with the City Clerk since the date of the
Board of Zoning Adjustment recommendation.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the application of Robert O'Brien to construct and operate a
maternity hospital on the north side of West Charleston between Brush and Upland legally 
described as Government Lot 55; Section 36, T20S, R61E, in an R-1 zone be referred back to the
Planning Commission for further study and recommendation.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Sharp and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem voting aye; noes, none. Absent:	Mayor C. D. Baker

and Commissioner Fountain.

URBAN RENEWAL	Planning Director Bills advised the Board of Commissioners that the City had been contacted by

the Urban Renewal authorities in regard to the reduced Federal Appropriation of Funds available
Adopted Resolution	for Urban Renewal Projects. The Federal Officials advised that under the reallocation formula

there would not be sufficient funds available to cover Project "Industrial" which is the project
for which an application was previously approved by the Board of Commissioners.

The Federal Officials further advised that the City had a period of six weeks in which to 
resubmit an application in the form of a reduction of Project "Industrial" or substitute a new
project. In order to proceed on a project which would do the most toward provision of new
homes under special provisions of the FHA Act concerning relocation of persons displaced by
any Governmental Action (freeway construction or Urban Renewal), it was decided to submit a
new application for Project "Madison" which is covered in the following resolution.

This is the same type of resolution that was approved in connection with the initial project;
that is, an application for an advance loan not to exceed $81,902.00 to cover advance planning
costs. The loan is to be repayable with interest only if the project is ultimately completed.
Adoption of this resolution commits the City to nothing other than conducting an advance planning
study.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple stated that he felt we should proceed with this project and adopt the
resolution.

Commissioner Bunker moved the following resolution entitled:	"A RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE

RESERVATION OF CAPITAL GRANT FUNDS, APPROVING THE UNDERTAKING OF SURVEYS AND PLANS FOR AN

RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners received many requests for the change of
name of 5th Street to LAS VEGAS BOULEVARD; and

WHEREAS, a Public Hearing was held by the Board on July 2, 1958 at which time
all persons interested in the matter were heard; and

WHEREAS, the matter was taken under advisement by the Board at that time; and

WHEREAS, the Board feels that it should now go on record as favoring the change
of name of 5th Street within the City Limits to "LAS VEGAS BOULEVARD", such change to
become official on July 1, 1959; and

WHEREAS, the adoption of this resolution at this time will allow the various
businesses located on the said street sufficient time to make necessary adjustments before

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las
Vegas, at a regular meeting thereof held on the 15th day of October, 1958, that 5th Street
within the City Limits of the City of Las Vegas should be changed to "LAS VEGAS BOULEVARD"

PASSED, ADOPTED AND APPROVED this 15th day of October, 1959.

Mrs. Giancontieri spoke from the audience stating that there were other badly needed road
improvements for which the City could spend their money other than for "name changes."

she thinks is Shadow Street by name. She further stated that a policeman was needed near
the Junior High School to direct traffic.

10-15-58

for the road improvements and this was tried about two years ago but was not successful.

Mrs. Giancontieri said she would find out the correct names of the streets and submit them
to the City Manager.

would use personally to conduct his professional serves; and

Deferred

Proposal of Dr. Ross Sutherland offering $65,000.00 for the Huntridge Fire Station in the
10-15-58
form of a lease purchase agreement; payments to be $6,500.00 per year or $541.67 per month
for a period of ten years, including option to buy the property at any time during the ten
years for a total price of $65,000.00; prepaid monthly rentals to be applied to the total
price.

Dr. Zellhoefer spoke from the audience stating that he is new here in town and his desire
is just to make a medical office for himself; no emergencies or surgery. He stated the
people in the area seem to think it is a good idea. His present offices must be vacated
by December 15, and for this reason he would like to know when he might have an answer.

He further stated that his offer is a cash offer consisting of whatever down-payment the
City would feel appropriate and a two month's option in order to enable him to liquidate
other holdings to pay the full purchase price if his proposal is accepted.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple stated that it would be impossible to give him an answer at this time
as Mayor Baker and Commissioner Fountain are out of town.

Commissioner Bunker moved that the matter be deferred in view of the fact that there are
two members of the Board not present at this meeting.

companies manufacturing high altitude chambers.

Mr. Kennedy further stated that with this equipment it would no longer be necessary to pay
veterinarian's fees for putting the animals to sleep and with the incinerator, neither would
it be necessary to bury them.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple asked if our employees at the Animal Shelter would be able to operate
these machines and was informed that they would be.

-0O0-

At the hour of 8:25 P.M. the meeting recessed and reconvened at the hour of 9:10 P.M. with
all members present as of the opening session.

-0O0-

Mr. Kennedy stated that in regard to the salary question discussed immediately prior to the
recess, he would like to clarify the point that in the case of Acting Fire Chief Williams
his recommendation of $750.00 per month would be below the first step of the Fire Chief Range
and that he would, therefore, suggest that the Acting Fire Chief be placed on the first
step of the Fire Chief Range.

Commissioner Bunker moved that the City Manager recommendations be approved and the following
salary increases placed in effect:

NAME	DEPARTMENT	STEP SCHEDULE DOLLARS

C. D. Williams	Fire	1-1	42	620-825

TREES	City Manager Kennedy stated that the City is receiving a great number of calls to pick up

Trimming and Removal	leaves from the gutters and also to request trimming of trees,

of Leaves

The cost of tree-trimming as people think it should be done would be prohibitive. The present
City policy is that if the City planted the trees, then is our our responsibility to take care of
them; if the people planted them, it is their responsibility. Picking up leaves throughout the
City would also be an expensive service.

Commissioner Sharp proposed that this situation be given some publicity in the newspapers
educating and advising the people how to dispose of this type of trash and just what the 
responsibility of the City is in such cases. It is very probable that the people just don't know
any different.

Mr. Kennedy further stated that the Southern Nevada Disposal, Inc. will pick up limbs that have
been tied into bundles not to exceed 10 feet in length and not to weigh over 100 lbs. Leaves
will be picked up by the disposal company if they are put in a container. This is a part of the
service people are paying for.



The City has a machine for picking up leaves by vacuum for cleaning park areas; however, an
several occasions when the machine was used to serve the general public, the machine was 
frequently damaged by a bottle or can or other objectbeing mixed up in the debris which has caused 
repair bills of as much as $2,000 to the machine. 10-15-58
Mayor Pro Tem Whipple suggested the people put this type of trash in proper containers and
bundles and let the disposal company pick them up.

DAMAGE TO STREETS	City Manager Kennedy reported to the Board that he has received letters from the Las Vegas

Courthouse	Builders' Exchange, Associated General Contractors of America and Laing-Garrett Construction

Construction	Specialties protesting the possibility of the City making any demand on them for damage to

pavement resulting from normal and necessary service to the Courthouse construction project.

In the discussion that followed it was agreed that some of the large equipment is breaking
down the paving. The City has already fixed one area. If an assessment district was put in,
the demand on the property owners would be too great.

Any weight over 5,000 lbs. is forbidden on the streets except on truck routes. Another
suggestion presented was that perhaps our truck licenses should be revised or else raise the
weight restriction up a little bit.

The fact remains that there exists a real problem and one that will probably increase with
big building projects coming up in the future.

Mr. Kennedy said that when he returns from out of town next week that he will contact these
companies concerned as there is a lot of misunderstanding on both sides.

There being no further business to come before the Board, at the hour of 9:15 P.M. Commissioner
Sharp moved this meeting adjourn.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Sharp and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem voting aye; noes, none. Absent:	Mayor C. D.

WOMEN DEALER POLICY           Mayor Pro Tem Whipple stated that the Commission would like to request the audience to be
Resolution Adopted	courteous and allow those women who wish to state their views regarding the question of

women dealers in the City of Las Vegas to do so without interruption. At this time the
Mayor Pro Tem asked anyone wishing to speak to step forward.

Betty Cotton:	I have been dealing cards here in Las	Vegas for	eleven years and I think

no more women	dealers should be allowed but that the	women who	have been dealing here should

be allowed to have their jobs.

Polly Carson:	I have been dealing in Las Vegas for ten years. I agree some men are out of

work due to women dealers. They are not going to replace girls with the men here tonight.

I do think we	should have a wage scale that would be	the same for women as for men —Reno	has

that. I have	worked with men who have received less	pay than	I did, due to seniority.	I

believe you can find this out if you investigate. What are these girls going to do? The
moral issue is ridiculous. The men who are not working would not be working regardless. The
Clubs on the Strip are all going to train and hire their own men and the old dealers will be
out anyway.

Connie Delaney:	I have been dealing in Las Vegas on and off for the last ten years. The

men have put in the objection saying that women have replaced them for a lower wage scale.

The way I see it, we did not replace any men — we were turned out and the men have replaced
us. We were not working for a lower wage scale. The wage scale is supposed to be $22.50
per day. There are quite a few working for a lot less. We start at $17.50 with chance for
a raise. I do not believe that is below scale. I do not believe that we did anything to
take the men's jobs away from them. We, too, are raising families without any help from
men. We deserve the right to work.

Urban Cisker:	You say about $22.50—what promises have you in regard to getting more?

Connie Delaney:	My income tax statements show I got more.

Urban Cisker:	Okay.

Jo Galster:	I know quite a few here and I would like to ask some questions. What is the

objection to the women working the clubs? That statement has not been clarified.

Eddie Draper:	We feel women dealers are against the welfare and economy of Las Vegas. We

do not want to have happen in Las Vegas what happened in Reno.

Jo Galster:	The majority of women working Las Vegas I believe have been working for some

years. I own my own home here. I have three kids. I don't have to work. My husband works
but I might have to go to work and I couldn't make enough money anywhere else. Women have
not lowered the wage scale. There isn't a club in town that hasn't broken in dealers at
eight and ten dollars a day. I have been dealing since 1947. Who does get below scale?

I don't understand why the women dealers were not notified of the first meeting. It seems
all the men showed up but only a couple of women were notified and we were not properly 
represented at that meeting.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple:	The meeting the other day was called by the men dealers. If the

ladies would ask for the same they would get it.

Jo Galster:	Are we refused the right to work?

Ruby Kent:	The girls did consult an attorney about appearing here tonight. I don't know

what happened but he didn't show up.

Connie Delaney:	The Nevada Club girls decided to get an attorney but after consulting an

an attorney were informed that even though he beat the case there would still be people who
would force them out of their jobs. We cannot afford a $1500.00 attorney's fee. As a matter
of fact we have already been laid off. We thought we might be able to reach a compromise
of some sort. We do not want an influx of women dealers. The ones who are here should not
be denied their right to work.

Rita Hansen: I have been dealing at the Las Vegas Club for the last three and one-half years
in which time I drew $22.50 per day, yet yesterday I was told I was unemployed because my
boss was told to take out all women dealers. The beef should be against those who would work
for less than scale of $22.50. All dealers should get together to keep the $22.50 scale.

11-5-58
Ralph G. Smith:	I have been in Las Vegas for eleven years. The women I see here were here

when I arrived. I know a lot of dealers from the Middle West, South and East and they came
here since all of these girls as far as I can see. What the argument is I presume is wages.

I don't think that is actually the issue. A lot of people in this town, I heard the girls
say, drew less wages than the girls did and I thirty the issue is to keep the wage scale up
and you can't keep the wage scale up by giving men less pay than'the women. The women,
therefore, are not lowering the wage scale.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple asked if there was a spokesman for the men dealers who cared to speak
at this time.

Eddie Draper:	I have been in the gambling business for 25 years. No one is opposed to women

dealing until it is a threat to the whole town and economy of Las Vegas — then something has
to be done about it. We do not want Las Vegas to become another Reno. Anyone familiar with
the economic situation in Reno prior to women dealers over men will tell you that the economic
condition was very high but there has been a downward trend since women dealers. Prior to
the winter of 1947 Crap dealers in Reno were getting $25.00 per day and "21" dealers were
getting $20.00 per day. Reno was the "biggest little city in America" but today it is hardly
even mentioned. One gambling establishment in Reno decided to put women to work. They started
them at $8.00 per day and worked them up to $15.00 per day and then threw them out in the street.
This made a very unhealthy economic situation. They say they will not do it here — wait until
they get into predominate numbers. Men are the basis for sound economy. A man when he gets
married should support his wife and the children that he has.

Las Vegas is the highest church town per capita in the United States. We favor men over
women because men are the head of the family. Would the men present who were driven out of
Reno and Tahoe by women Dealers please stand. (At this point a large number of men stood.)

When you get back to the aspect of the gambling business, we have operated it on a high plane
in Las Vegas. A lot of players come down here instead of going to Reno because of jealousy
caused when the husband gambles where there is a woman dealer. One banker in Reno estimated
$50,000,000.00 in gambling business has come down to Las Vegas since the advent of women dealers
there. Gambling in this State has never been on a referendum for the people to decide. It is
a "privileged business." The health and welfare of the people is involved and the police take
these matters under surveillance.

Mr. Beatty of the Southern Nevada Credit Bureau has contacted business people who do not want
to see women dealers in Las Vegas. I have before me a report from the Southern Nevada Chamber
of Commerce Research and Statistical Bureau which states that Las Vegas Business is at a new
high. According to up to date analysis report it shows the general economic trend has continued 
to surge ahead. You cannot read this about Reno. If we get women dealers it is going
to take a downward trend. Nevada is the fastest growing State in the Nation and most of the
increase is in Clark County. We have kept the economic plane on a very high level but if we
do like Reno did it is going to be in sad shape.

Jo Galster:	How do you figure a minority of women dealers is going to ruin the economy?

Eddie Draper:	Mr. Van Santen said he would absorb all of the women in his organization.

Jo Galster:	I am speaking on behalf of one girl in particular who has three children and

has been here in Las Vegas for 15 years. Worked at the Monte Carlo.

Eddie Draper:	Would	you as an individual or a minority group want to destroy the economy

of this community?

Jo Galster:	I do not believe a few women dealers would destroy the economy of Las Vegas

or Clark County.

Eddie Draper:	What would happen if maybe 1500 of these men dealers would be replaced by

women?

Jo Galster:	Why isn't there a law preventing new women dealers from being hired?

Eddie Draper:	That would leave a loophole for other establishments to demand to be able to

hire women dealers also.

Connie Delaney:	When I spoke earlier I was against the influx of women dealers. We do not

want this either. I got laid off yesterday and was replaced by a man.

Eddie Draper:	Where were you working six weeks ago?

Connie Delaney:	I came down from Lake Tahoe when Mr. Van Santen called for me.

Eddie Draper:	We have no beef as a minority group; however, we know that once these club

owners put women dealers in here in a majority that it will pull the economy down.

Rita Hansen:	I went to Reno in 1942 as a dealer. I was in Las Vegas in 1945 and there were

more women dealers then than there are now. I don't work unless I have to. I have two children
of my own. A survey of the men dealers in this town right now would show that not more than
30 percent have been here over five or ten years. The women dealing have been here ten to
fifteen years.

Billy Johnson: I think the girls who have been working here for a long time should be able
to work -- at least those who have been here five years or more. Most of these women are 
homeowners and have children in school here.

Elmer Button:	I have been here as long as any of these women. If men do come in here from

other states they are supporting families.

Commissioner Fountain:	The Commission has information that Mr. Van Santen was supposedly

threatened over this episode and we would like to hear from Chief Sheffer in regard to this.

Chief Sheffer:	I had heard the same stories that Mr. Van Santen had been threatened relative

to employment of female dealers. I contacted him yesterday afternoon and he assured me he had
not been threatened. Also a License Division Sergeant has investigated the matter with the same
findings.

Ed Forsine:	I have lived in the State of Nevada over twenty-five years; 17 years of which I

spent in Reno and I just came down here as the girls drove me out. Why should they hire me for

11-5-58
$25.00 a day when they could hire a girl for $15.00? It isn't your ability anymore it is a
matter of who you know. In a lot of families in Reno both husband and wife are working. I
left my home in Reno and came down to Las Vegas so I could earn a living; and it would be
best to stop the influx of women dealers before it starts.

Commissioner Bunker:	The City Clerk has a resolution which I request that he read.

The City Clerk read the following resolution in full:

RESOLUTION

WHEREAS; the Board of Commissioners has the delegated power under the Charter of
the City of Las Vegas to regulate or prohibit and suppress gaming houses and gambling; and

WHEREAS; there appears to be the possibility of women being employed in gambling
clubs as dealers; and

WHEREAS; the employment of women as dealers in gambling houses is contrary to the
best interests of the City of Las Vegas and its citizens because such activity on the part
of women creates bad publicity for the area and tends to induce certain people to gamble
who would not otherwise; and

WHEREAS; from a consideration of all the facts as to the employment or nonemployment 
of women; the Board feels that it is in the public interest and for the general
welfare; protection of public safety; and for the protection of public morals that women
be prevented from engaging in the occupation of dealers within the gambling houses and clubs
of the City of Las Vegas.

NOW; THEREFORE; BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las
Vegas at a regular meeting thereof held on the 5th day of November; 1958 that it be declared 
as the policy of said Board that no women be employed as "dealers"; as such term
is commonly understood in gambling circles; within the gambling clubs and houses of the
City of Las Vegas.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this prohibition is not deemed to apply to shills;
check rackers; change girls; cocktail waitresses; and bingo games.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this expression of policy of the Board be communicated
to every gambling club operator within the City of Las Vegas.

PASSED; ADOPTED AND APPROVED this 5th day of November; 1958.

the Planning Commission, and it is expected that a report or recommendation will be submitted
to the Planning Commission the first part of November.

Planning Director Bills stated that this application for Variance is somewhat similar to the
application of Robert O'Brien (V-14-58) which was referred back to the Planning Commission for
further study and recommendation as to zoning changes for hospitals.

Mrs. Longo spoke from the audience stating that there are enough problems without having a
hospital in this location.

Commissioner Fountain moved the application of the 20th Century Coal Company for a variance to
operate and maintain a hospital and rest home at 1500 Bryant, north of West Owens, legally
described as the NW¼, SW¼, SW¼, Section 21, T20S, R61E, in an R-E zone, be denied.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Fountain and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes, none. Absent:

Mayor C. D. Baker and Commissioner Sharp.

The Commission considered the application of Robert Cohen for a variance to build within a
required rear year at 1005 Yucca Place between 10th Street and Maryland Parkway, legally
described as Lot 11, Block 2, Huntridge #1, in an R-1 zone.

Denial recommended by the Board of Zoning Adjustment on the basis that this property is in
an R-1 zone; however, it has a rental unit on it which is not permitted in an R-1 zone. There
is one protest.

Planning Director Bills stated that in 1952 permit was issued to build a laundry room and
instead an additional dwelling unit was built in violation of the building ordinance.

Mr. John Porter, Attorney, spoke for Robert Cohen, stating that the matter was placed in
his hands just this afternoon and he hadn't time to question this report; however, he would
appreciate it if this matter could be held in abeyance until Mr. Cohen returns from Europe. He
further stated that Mr. Cohen acquired this property very recently and was not aware of a violation. 
This unit is presently being used by the housekeeper and caretaker and not as a rental.
He added that this variance is simply to be used for the enlargement of this private home. He
informed the Commission that Mr. Cohen should be back by the middle or latter part of November.

Commissioner Fountain moved that the application of Robert Cohen for a variance to build within
a required rear yard at 1005 Yucca Place, between 10th Street and Maryland Parkway, legally
described as Lot 11, Block 2, Huntridge #1, in an R-1 zone, be held in Abeyance until the
regular meeting of the Board of City Commissioners to be held December 3, 1958.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Fountain and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes, none. Absent:

Mayor C. D. Baker and Commissioner Sharp.

The Board considered Traffic and Parking Commission's request from St. Anne's Church for a
passenger loading zone. Approval recommended by the Traffic end Parking Commission for a zone
133 feet long on Maryland Parkway, starting at a point 30' south of Oakey Boulevard.

Planning Director Bills stated that a 4-space loading zone is allowed for any church and this
would be 33' more than that established by policy; however, this 33' would be the space left
between the regular size loading zone and a driveway.

Commissioner Bunker moved that the request of St. Anne's Church for a passenger loading zone
133 feet long on Maryland Parkway starting at a point 30 feet south of Oakey Boulevard, be
approved.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Fountain and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes, none. Absent:

Mayor C. D. Baker and Commissioner Sharp.

Planning Director Bills presented the McNeil Park Revised Tentative Map to the Commission.

The revision consists of the redesign of lot lines reducing the width of lots from 120 feet
to 100 feet; thereby creating one additional lot in each tier. Mr. Bills further stated that
this would add seven lots and further that the size of the lots are still way over the minimum
requirement.

Assistant City Attorney Hawkins advised that in regard to the presently recorded subdivision
map, it will be necessary for the subdivider to comply with NRS 278.490 prior to approval of
the new final map by the Mayor and Board of City Commissioners.

Commissioner Bunker moved that the McNeil Park Tentative map be approved.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Fountain and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes, none. Absent:

Mayor C. D. Baker and Commissioner Sharp.

Planning Director Bills presented the Southridge #6 Tentative Map including the following
changes:

1.	The subdivision boundaries have been extended to include the abutting one-
half of the adjacent streets, which means that the developer will install
all half-street improvements surrounding the subdivision.

2.	The corner lots which are of a 60 feet width will have a 15 foot setback
line along the side street which is in accordance with the subdivision
regulation. The Planning Commission, because of the circumstances involved,
waived the 65 foot required width.

Mr. Bills stated that the original map did not include the streets in any way whatsoever which
was recommended by the Planning Commission and that lots 1, 6, 8 and 9 did not meet the requirements 
of the ordinance for 65 feet. The principal concern of the Planning Commission
and this Board was not so much these lots as making sure the improvements were installed.

The map has been redrawn so it is clear all improvements have been included and shows 15 foot
setback even on these lots.

Commissioner Fountain moved that the Southridge #6 Tentative Map be approved as resubmitted.

TENTATIVE MAP	the City Commission for further study. The map is now in order and approval recommended

by the Planning Commission.

Approved

Planning Director Bills stated this map was previously submitted to the Board along with
Kasper Park. In the case of both there was no assurance at that time that water could be
furnished economically. This problem has been worked out; however, there were serious
sewerage and drainage problems in connection with Kasper Park that do not exist in the
Sunset Manor #3 Tract.

Commissioner Bunker moved that the Sunset Manor #3 Tentative Map be approved as recommended
by the Planning Commission.

NORTH LAS VEGAS FIRE	City Manager Kennedy requested authorization for Captain George Rambo of the Las Vegas Fire

DEPARTMENT TRAINING	Department to be employed on his off-duty hours as Training and Advisory Officer of the North

OFFICER	Las Vegas Fire Department.

Captain George Rambo	Commissioner Fountain stated that he thought this might set a precedent; however, City Manager

Kennedy informed the Commission that very close restrictions are put on this and he would like
to grant the request at least until appointment of a permanent North Las Vegas Fire Chief.

Commissioner Fountain asked how long Captain Rambo had been working with the North Las Vegas
Fire Dept, and City Manager Kennedy stated that it had been about five or six months.

Acting Chief Williams said that there was a period inbetween when he did no work down there.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple asked how this can be arranged with firemen working 24 hours on and	-

24 hours off. Acting Chief Williams stated that could be arranged and that it was clearly
understood that it was not to interfere with his work with the Las Vegas Fire Department.

He further stated that the City of North Las Vegas had purchased a number of Las Vegas Drill
Manuals and he felt that Captain Rambo was better qualified to instruct them in North Las
Vegas than any of their own personnel.

Commissioner Fountain stated that he was in favor of helping North Las Vegas but suggested
that the arrangement be closely controlled.

Robert F. Boos

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple asked what period this would cover and Mr. Kennedy replied from February
to June. Commissioner Bunker asked if Mr. Boos could be spared from his work and whether he
did not have enough to do to keep him busy. Mr. Kennedy said that he had sufficient work to
keep him busy and that Mr. Boos had stated that while he would be willing to assist the university, 
it made no great difference to him whether the request was granted or not. It might
be that he would have to work later at the City Hall.

Mr. Kennedy stated that he would advise Dr. Wright of Nevada Southern that the request is 
appreciated but the Board does not feel it would be appropriate.

AMERICAN LEGION	City Manager Kennedy presented the request of the American Legion to set off rockets and, or,

Mr. Kennedy stated this prisoner has been examined by the doctor several times and he

Owens Avenue and extension of Foremaster Lane from Main Street to Owens Street providing that
the City would enter into a firm agreement with the State that Owens Street would continue to
remain open from Fifth Street to Decatur and further that the City would agree to construct
certain improvements including a drain for the area.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple stated that he had talked to Otis Wright of the State Highway Department
regarding drainage in conjunction with the freeway and that he felt the City could not go into

WHEREAS, the property needed to be acquired for right-of-way purposes is owned by
Gladys C. Harris of 425 East Ocean Boulevard, Long Beach, California, who is unwilling to 
dedicate the necessary area to the City of Las Vegas for such purposes.

at a regular meeting thereof held on the 5th day of November, 1958 that it is necessary to

Request for Lease	an acre of the forty (40) acres owned by the City of Las Vegas located approximately one-quarter

of City Property	mile northwest of Highway 91 in North Las Vegas; the land to be used to build a building for

the North Las Vegas V.F.W. and American Legion.

Helen Herr spoke from the floor stating that the North Las Vegas V.F.W. and American Legion
do not have a place for their meetings and building might be available from Nellis Air Force
Base if they had a place to put it. They have no money to buy land hut by pooling their
resources of money and man-power, they will be able to move the building and bring it up to
code if they could lease a piece of land from the City of Las Vegas which is located in Section
12 in North Las Vegas. They would require approximately 200' x 350' or 2½ or 3 acres.

Commissioner Fountain asked just what location on the property was desired.	j

Mr. George Reynolds, Commander of the V.F.W. of North Las Vegas spoke from the audience
stating that they would like any of the 40 acres that fronts on Pecos St. Not only would
they like to put up a service home, but would like enough land for a ball park and picnic
grounds.

Commissioner Fountain asked Mr. Reynolds if he felt 2½ or 3 acres would be enough and stated
further that he would be in favor of leasing them this land for this purpose but suggested
they bring in a more definite map or plot plan.

Commissioner Sharp added that these would also be a proposed lease drawn. With regard to
the lease, City Attorney Cannon advised that it will be necessary to determine for what length
of time it should run and that it might be well for it to be revocable in the event the City
might desire to sell this property at some later date.

It was suggested that the Engineering Department prepare a detailed sketch of the area and that
Helen Herr and Mr. Reynolds contact Mr. Kennedy to work out the details of the situation.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Approved	Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

REZONING (Z-13-58)	The Commissioner considered the application of M.M. Bishp and H.W. Snyder to reclassify

M.M. Bishp & H.W. Snyder               Lots 12 & 16 Block 8, Boulder Addition from R-4 to C-1.

Approved	Planning Director Bills stated that the Planning Commission recommends that the application

be amended to include All of the lots on the east side of the block, which would be Lots
9 through 16, Block 8, Boulder Addition and that it be approved as amended.

Mr. Bills stated further that this would expand the application to include the entire
	one-half block. The property in question is presently R-4 and backs up to property

presently used for industrial purposes and there are now a couple of semi-commercial uses
located in this area. All the property on 2nd Street is on the General Land Use Plan
which has tentatively been approved. It would seem logical for this property to be used
for commercial purposes at this time. One of the applicants will develop immediately if
this application is granted. A person across the street asked questions about the proposed
rezoning, but did not voice any protest.

Commissioner Fountain moved that the application of M.M. Bishop and H.W. Snyder to reclassify
	Lots 12 and 16, Block 8, Boulder Addition from R-4 to C-1 be approved as recommended by

the Planning Commission to include all of the lots on the east side of the block, which would
be Lots 9 through 16, Block 8, Boulder Addition.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

STEAM ENGINE DISPLAY	The Commission considered the request of Henry Bridgman, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce

Chamber of Commerce	Museum Committee, for permission to locate a steam engineer for display purposes at the southwest 

corner of 5th and Bonanza. (Approval of location was recommended by the Planning
Held in Abeyance	Commission.)

His Honor, Mayor Baker asked what size locomotive this would be, how it was going to be
transported to the site and if it was to be fenced in some manner.

Mr. Bridgman spoke from the floor stating that this was NO. 3800 Engine, 125' in length,
and they would propose that it be fenced.

Commissioner Sharp asked if it would be placed far enough back on the corner so it would
not impede the vision of traffic.

Mayor Baker expressed the opinion that this particular piece of ground might be needed for
further recreational facilities that are planned for the future.

Commissioner Sharp suggested a rough plot of it be drawn so the Board can visualize just
how it would work out. Mr. Bridgman was of the opinion that it would fit right in at this
particular corner. Commissioner Fountain said he would like to give it some thought and
	study and also would like to see a sketch.

Commissioner Whipple	asked Mr. Bridgman how much time he had to find a location and Mr.

Bridgman stated that	these engines are being scrapped and it is important to find a place

to put the engine as	soon as possible and he further stated they had to have the location

before the Union Pacific will send the engine out.

Commissioner Bunker moved that the request of Henry Bridgman, Chairman of the Chamber of
Commerce, Museum Committee, for permission to locate a steam engine for display purposes
at the Southwest corner of 5th and Bonanza, be held in abeyance for further study.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

PLOT PLAN	The Board considered	the request of Royes Petersen to appear before the City Commission to

St. Louis Ave. between                 discuss his proposed	plot plan for construction of a 94-unit apartment project and the

Santa Paula Drive                           and question of using the right-of-way adjacent to the curb for access to diagonal parking on
Weldon Place	all 4 sides of the project.

Royes Petersen	On October 9, 1958, this matter was before the Planning Commission and no action was taken.

On October 16, 1958, this matter was before the Traffic and Parking Commission and they
voted unanimously that the builder must conform to the ordinance and that this plan will be
considered when redrawn according to ordinance.

Mr. Petersen spoke to the Board stating that he was never given notice of any meeting;
however, Mr. Bills, Director of Planning was requested by Mr. Cahlan to present this matter.

He further stated that the buildings will be set way back from the street and could see no
reason why something couldn't be worked out. He said this will be one of the most beautiful
buildings that he has built here in Las Vegas. The only contact he had with the traffic and
zoning man was when he pinned him down and asked him if his child was coming down this street,
would he rather have him by the street or up against the buildings. He stated they said he
was asked to this Traffic Commission meeting but actually that this was not so. He further
stated he would like consideration for it anyway; his buildings are set way back and he
would like room enough for shrubs, swimming pools and recreation area. Two sidewalks within
30' would be awfully hard to accept.

Commissioner Whipple asked if his plan was to eliminate the sidewalk by the curb and put the
sidewalk against the building which Mr. Petersen affirmed.

Mr. Petersen went on to say that he has paid $1500.00 for each apartment for the land alone
and he wants to make a beautiful presentation.

Commissioner Fountain asked if he had discussed these plans with the Planning Commission
and Mr. Petersen stated that Mr. Cahlan told Mr. Bills to present it to the Commission.

Commissioner Bunker asked if it was legal under existing ordinance and Mr. Petersen replied
that it was not.

11-19-58
Director of Public Works Sauer stated that Mr. Petersen developed El Centro #2 and posted
a check in the amount of $2278.60 to cover offsite improvements which have never been 
completed; specifically, the sidewalk adjacent to the curb. In answer to this; Mr. Petersen
said that he would be glad to put them in.

Mr. Sauer said there is still the matter of the personal check being held by the Treasurer.

When Commissioner Fountain asked for how long; he answered since 1954. Mr. Petersen asked
Mr. Sauer to go on and tell them why and went on to say he had been turned down on different
ideas.

Commissioner Bunker stated that we cannot approve something that is in violation of an
ordinance.

Mr. Petersen asked how Market Town got by as there is not a sidewalk in the entire block.

Commissioner Whipple asked Mr. Sauer if they would not work something out on this. Mr.

Sauer stated he thought so and requested time to meet with Mr. Petersen to see what could
be worked out.

USE PERMIT (U-23-58)	The Commission considered the application of James Nicholson; Jr. for a Use Permit to conduct 

James Nicholson; Jr.	a jewelry repair business as a customary home occupation at 622 West McWilliams; legally

described as Lots 11 and 12; Block 20; Original Las Vegas Townsite; in an R-3 zone. Approval
Denied	recommended by the Board of Zoning Adjustment subject to the following restrictions: (There

was one letter of protest.)

1.	That the permit be non-transferable.

2. That the operation be inspected annually by the License Department.

3. That no signs or other forms of advertising be permitted on the premises; and that no
selling be permitted.

4.	The signing of an improvement agreement and the posting of a bond for the installation of
sidewalks as recommended by the Engineering Department.

This application was considered by the Commissioners at their regular meeting held November
5, 1958; and held in abeyance until this meeting. At that time Planning Director Bills said
there are to be 5-foot sidewalks installed under an improvement agreement and a $581.00 bond
is required. The improvement agreement has not been signed and the bond has not been posted.

Commissioner Bunker moved that the application of James Nicholson; Jr. for a use permit to
conduct a jewelry repair business as a customary home occupation at 622 West McWilliams; legally
described as Lots 11 and 12; Block 20; Original Las Vegas Townsite; in an R-3 zone; be denied
because the applicant has not complied with the instructions of the Board of Zoning Adjustment.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners Bunker

Fountain; Sharp; Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes; none.

BID OPENING - NO. 58.23            This being the time heretofore set for the opening of Bid No. 58.23 for the furnishing of all

ASSESSMENT DISTRICT 100-43   The Commission considered plans; specifications and estimates of cost for the installation
Street Lighting on	of street lighting on North Main Street; from Carson Avenue north to North City Limits.

Main St. from Carson	Resolution was adopted by the Board of City Commissioners on July 2, 1958, instructing the

to North City Limits	Engineering Department to prepare plats; plans; specifications and estimate of cost.

Director of Public Works Sauer advised the Board that the estimated cost is $40,073.99.

Commissioner Whipple asked what percentage was in favor and Mr. Sauer advised that in the
section from Bonanza to North City Limits there are better than 51 percent; whereas; from
Carson to Bonanza there were less than 51 percent required. It adds up to not enough for
the entire district but there are sufficient in favor for the area from Bonanza to North
City Limits. If we could arrange an informal hearing to get a more complete account of those
for and against; it might be that more would be in favor of this proposed street lighting.

The district could be reduced. There is some street lighting from Carson to Bonanza but it
is outmoded.

City Manager Kennedy suggested a couple of hearings with those people might help because
present lights between Carson and Bonanza do not meet any of the Standards.

Commissioner Fountain stated that the area for the proposed street lighting is possibly
where the freeway will be constructed; and raised the question of moving the lights. City
Manager Kennedy stated if this should happen the State would move them.

His Honor Mayor Baker asked for what area the estimate was figured and Mr. Sauer stated it
was for the entire area from Carson to North City Limits. The Cost is $2.90 per front foot of
property. He again stated the district would be reduced to just that portion of Main Street
from Bonanza to the North City Limits if the entire district cannot be included.

Commissioner Whipple moved that an informal public hearing be held after the first of the year.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker; Fountain; Sharp; Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes; none.

of twenty days to permit them to complete the work which would extend the completion date
to November 28, 1958.

Las Vegas, Nevada
December 3, 1958

A regular meeting of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada,
held this 3rd day of December, 1958, was called to order at the hour of 7:30 P.M.
by His Honor Mayor Baker with the following members present:

Mayor	C. D. Baker

Commissioner	Wendell Bunker

Commissioner	E. W. Fountain

Commissioner	Harris Pi Sharp

Commissioner	Reed Whipple

City Manager	A. H. Kennedy

Asst. City Attorney	Ralston O. Hawkins

Planning Director	Franklin J. Bills

Dir. Public Works	Richard P. Sauer

Acting City Clerk	Robert F. Boos

Absent:	City Attorney	Howard W. Cannon

WEST CHARLESTON BLVD.        His Honor Mayor Baker opened the meeting by referring to the accident on West Charleston
Traffic Hazard	Boulevard the day before in which a child was injured, but fortunately not seriously.

He stated that he had talked with the Chairman of the County Commission this morning
and they agreed to cooperate with the City in eliminating the existing traffic hazard with
respect to pedestrian crossing at this location. We have checked reports from the Sheriff's
Department and Police Department and available technical advice, and have developed a plan
that will remedy this situation and others similar to this one.

Mr. Harley Harmon, Chairman of the Board of County Commissioners stated that after talking
to the County Officials and to Mayor Baker today, it is recommended that a button control
stop and go light be installed at the joint cost of the City and County; also that curbs
be installed around the Panorama Market. Further, it is recommended that street lights be
placed in front of Bill Hinson's place and by the service station to light that area. That
would give us four lights there.

Mayor Baker asked if there was any objection to this joint arrangement. Commissioners
Fountain and Whipple stated they thought the plan should be started immediately and the
rest of the Commissioners were in agreement.

Mr. Bill Hinson spoke from the floor stating that he was at the meeting this afternoon, and
in regard to installation of a curb and parallel parking along the street side, it was his
opinion it would present another hazard if parking is allowed in this manner. He suggested
it would be better to move the curb out to the edge of the street so that all parking would
be over next to the sidewalk and the hazard on the street side of the highway would be
eliminated.

Commissioner Fountain said he felt we should have our Traffic Engineer and Chief of Police
check this situation out and whatever expense is necessary should be forthwith approved.

Mr. Harmon spoke again stating that the main thing would be the stop and go light with push
button control as a 24-hour control would not be necessary. The curb installation and parking
questions are problems of the County which will have to be worked out with the County 
Commission.

Commissioner Fountain moved that immediate steps be taken to work the problem out with the

legally described as a portion of the NW¼, SW¼, SW¼, NE¼, Section 28, T20S, R61E, in an R-E zone.

Held in Abeyance

Approval is recommended by the Board of Zoning Adjustment, subject to conformance with the
plot plan as amended and the dedication of 15' of right-of-way along Highland. The church
has signed a Quitclaim Deed for the right-of-way. There were no protests.

Planning Director Bills stated that the Board of Zoning Adjustment withheld action on this
matter until there was a legibly drawn plot plan submitted. He further stated there were
some questions asked that might be interpreted as protests; however, the parties were not
protesting the location of the church but wanted to be sure it was a piece of architecture
in conformance with the neighborhood.

Commissioner Bunker asked if there were any plans on the church and Mr. Bills said that
there were. Commissioner Fountain asked if the Church people owned the property and Mr.

Bills said it was under a contract sale.

The Mayor asked if there was anyone here representing the church and the Rev. P. S. Walker
stepped forward. He stated that the proposed church was to be a $125,000.00 structure of
reinforced concrete block construction and that it would be a beautiful building. He said
there were 35 or 40 adult members of the church and 100 or 150 children.

Commissioner Whipple asked if it would be feasible for so few to build a church costing
this much money. Commissioner Bunker asked how much money is available at the present
time to put into this building and the Reverend answered that they had about $5,000 cash to
start with. He further stated that it was their desire to build a structure that was
worthwhile. Commissioner Fountain asked how long it was expected to take to complete the
church in view of the small amount of funds. Rev. Walker stated that they could apply the
the home office for a loan and that they have no reason to believe they would be rejected
and that they hoped to be able to complete the building sometime within the next 8 or 9
months.

Commissioner Whipple said that he was not opposed to them building a church but suggested
they get a letter of commitment from the home office or some concrete statement that they
will be able to obtain the necessary financing. Commissioner Fountain stated that he
could not support this plan with no more evidence of the financing than they seem
to now have.

Mayor Baker explained that the Board would like to have evidence from the Reverend and the
Church people of their ability to construct a building such as they propose to build
in a certain amount of time. His Honor went on to say that Use Permits are unusual and
the Board must be very particular, and that upon submission of additional information for
the Board's evaluation and study, this application will again be brought up before the
Commission.

PARADISE PALMS PLOT PLAN      Mr. Sauer, Director of Public Works presented the Plot Plan which Mr. Petersen had 
St. Louis Ave. between               submitted. He explained that by allowing sidewalks all around, adjacent to the building, the
Santa Paula Drive and	cars would be backed	out into parking lane but not into traffic lanes; however, he	stated

Weldon Place	this would not be in	accordance with existing ordinance.

Referred to Parking &	Mr. Petersen entered	the discussion and stated he believed to follow the ordinance	would

Traffic Commission	create more of a hazard than his proposed plan. He said it could be changed around to

make it legal but it wouldn't be as desirable. Commissioner Sharp stated there is a definite
traffic hazard, especially on St. Louis Avenue, and Mr. Petersen asked if it would meet the
Board's approval if curb cuts were used on St. Louis. Commissioner Sharp replied this would
still be in violation of the ordinance.

The point was brought up in regard to the planned widening of St. Louis Avenue and Mr. Sauer
said this was taken into consideration in these plans. Commissioner Bunker stated he thought
something could be worked out and that perhaps the Board wants to amend the ordinance. Mr.

Sauer stated that because of the continual curb cut, it is not in compliance with the ordinance.
Mayor Baker said he would rather have the cars parked off the street than on the street
and that there was also a traffic problem if there was a curb. Commissioner Bunker said he
was certainly in favor of the project if the parking problem could be worked out.

Commissioner Sharp moved this matter be referred to the Traffic and Parking Commission.

Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

HOUSE MOVING	The Commission considered the request	of Robert P. Porter,	owner, to move 5 motel units from	j

Harold Larson, reported these buildings have been inspected and that they meet with current	!

Approved	code requirements. He further stated that the signatures of property owners within 300' had

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

SET-BACK REQUIREMENTS             Madison B. Graves, Attorney, representing Mr. Robert Brooks, owner of the property at 1600
South 2nd between	South 5th St., and Ira Marshak, Architect, appeared before	the Board requesting that necessary

Wyoming and Oakey	ordinance change be made to eliminate	designation of South	2nd Street as a major street 

consisting of 80' of right-of-way.

Referred to Planning

It is proposed to build a fine shopping center building on the property surrounded by South 5th
Street, Oakey Boulevard, South 2nd Street and Wyoming Street. Normally in a commercially zoned
lot, the owner may build his building completely within the entire lot area, with setbacks
only where required for the future widening of through streets. In this instance South 5th
Street is shown on the Proposed Master Plan of Highways and Streets, and the proposed building ,
is designed to meet that requirement, i. e. a 10' setback from the property line; however,
the existing ordinance requires an 80' right-of-way on South 2nd Street, which is not a through
street and is not so designated on the Proposed Master Plan.	

It is undesirable to place the building 15' back from the curb and 7½ back from the West	

property line (along South 2nd Street) as it would cause a loss of parking area at the front of
the building and there would be no gain on South 2nd Street as there is no practical, need
for a 15' sidewalk.

Commissioner Sharp moved that this request be referred to the Planning Commission for 
recommendation on decreasing the setback line on South 2nd Street.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

HOUSE MOVING	The Commission considered the request of Mr. & Mrs. Thomas H. Petrie to move a house from

Mr. & Mrs. Thomas H	302 Lewis to 1713 Elm Street. The Building and safety Division has inspected the house

Harold Larson, stated that there was also an accessory building 10' x 18' considered to be
Approved	moved as well as the house which is of substantial construction. At this point Mr. Larson

showed snapshots of the buildings to the Board.

Commissioner Fountain moved that the request of Mr. & Mrs. Thomas H. Petrie to move a house
from 302 Lewis to 1713 Elm Street be approved.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

that the contract be reopened or alternated on a monthly basis insofar as City calls are
concerned. Mr. Kennedy stated that the present contract with the Mercy Ambulance Service
has expired but is being continued on a month to month basis.

Commissioner Fountain asked if the City was satisfied with the service of the Mercy
Ambulance and Police Chief Sheffer stated that the Police Department is satisfied with

that up to this time there has been only one licensed ambulance company in the City. In

HUNTRIDGE FIRE STATION	The Commission again considered Dr. Zellhoefer's $50,000.00 cash offer for the purchase of

PROPOSAL	Huntridge Fire Station for the purpose of converting it into a medical office which he would

use personally to conduct his professional services.

Dr. Howard Zellhoefer

and	At this time, Bill Morse, Attorney representing Dr. Sutherland, came forward to renew the

Dr. Sutherland	offer to lease this property under proposal previously submitted. Mayor Baker made reference

to Dr. Sutherland's letter of November 1, 1958, and the apparent assertion that the Board
of Commissioners had made a commitment to enter into a lease which was not the case.

Mr. Morse agreed and further stated that legally the Board could not do so at that time;
however, they thought the Board was very receptive this summer when they made the proposal.

Dr. Sutherland did spend some money on plans and specifications and also on equipment — the
exact amount he did not know. As for the equipment, the Doctor told him that it could be
utilized over a long period of time. He further stated that his client could not offer a
cash bid because of financial conditions.

12-3-58
Mayor Baker said he was more conderned with Mr. Bruner's letter and remarks concerning
breach of faith and that there had been no indication to anyone that the City was in a position
to consider a cash offer. Mr. Morse said the letter was not written in that spirit. He
further stated that they did feel their proposal to lease offered more to the City than the
cash offer.

Mayor Baker asked if there was anyone else wishing to speak with regard to the Huntridge
Fire Station property and Dr. Howard Zellhoefer spoke from the audience to the effect that
his $50,000.00 cash offer still stands.

The information was brought forth that no bids were received on the last advertised bid for
cash offers for the Huntridge Fire Station property which were to be opened October 1, 1958,
and that Dr. Zellhoefer came into the office of the City Clerk on October 6, 1958 and pre-
sented a letter and his offer for $50,000.00.

Mayor Baker asked if the record is clear insofar as the City records are concerned. Ralston
Hawkins, Assistant City Attorney, stated that Dr. Zellhoefer submitted his bid after the
sale of this property was advertised and if the Board feels that his offer is fair and just,
it is legally acceptable.

Commissioner Fountain asked Dr. Zellhoefer when he would be able to close the escrow and he
agreed to pay the $50,000.00 in 30 days. Commissioner Bunker asked what arrangement the City
had with the County offices presently located in the Huntridge Fire Station Building and Mr.
Hawkins said it was just a month to month lease basis and that it will be in order to notify
them of the termination on a specific date. Dr. Zellhoefer said that he could give the
County 60 days to vacate the premises.

Commissioner Bunker moved that the cash proposal of Dr. Howard Zellhoefer to purchase the
Huntridge Fire Station property for $50,000.00, payment to be made in full on or before
January 5; 1959; be accepted.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the City Clerk be instructed to write a letter to the Board
of County Commissioners informing them that this property has been sold and that it would
be appreciated if they would make the necessary arrangements to move the election office
presently located in the Huntridge Fire Station as soon as possible after January 5; 1959;
and in any event, not later than January 31; 1959*

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Abeyance	an R-E Zone.

(Taken up again at end                  At the meeting of the Board of Commissioners held December 3,1958
of Minutes)	this application was held in abeyance until this meeting and the

church people had been requested to produce evidence of their
ability to construct a building such as they propose to build in
a definite period of time. Planning Director Bills stated to the
Board that there was nothing new on this application and there
was no one present from the church to give further information.

This application had been continued from the Commission Meetings of
November 5, December 3 and December 17, 1958 due to the fact that Mr.
Cohen was out of the City. The City Clerk reported to the Board that
a letter had been received from Attorney John Porter that Mr. Cohen
was still out of town and requested another continuance.

a variance to build within a required rear yard at 1005 Yucca Place,
between 10th Street and Maryland Parkway, legally described as Lot 11,
Block 2, Huntridge #1, in an R-1 zone, be removed from the agenda and

SETBACK REQUIREMENTS	The Commission considered the	request of Mr. Robert Brooks to amend

Oakey	2nd between Wyoming and Oakey	Blvd. is not designated	as a major

Robert Brooks	street and setback of 40 feet	from the center line of	the right-of-way

would no longer be required.

Abeyance

Mr. Bills, Director of Planning, reported that the Planning Commission
had held three successive meetings (one at the site) in regard to this
request and their recommendation is that there should be no change in
Ordinance No. 659 at this time. Suggested as an alternative is a proposal
to abandon South 2nd Street from Wyoming to Oakey and improve Wyoming
to make a workable traffic movement from South 2nd through Wyoming
on to South Fifth —preliminary sketches that had been prepared by the
Planning and Engineering Departments were shown to the Board.

Architect Ira Marshak presented to the Board the proposed plot plan
for the development of this property showing the layout of the stores
and parking for the shopping center. Attorney Madison Graves stated
that the 7-1/2 feet required for the 40 foot setback from the center
line of the right-of-way is in the legal ownership of Mr. Brooks as it
was deeded to the owner before the adoption of Ordinance No. 659. The
point was brought out that should the ordinance be amended that the
setback should be all the way from Oakey to Charleston.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the request of Mr. Brooks to amend
Ordinance No. 659 Master Plan of Streets and Highways so that South
2nd between Wyoming and Oakey Blvd. is not designated as a major
street and setback of 40 feet from the center line of the right-of-
way would no longer be required, be held in abeyance.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following
vote:	Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor

Mayor Baker voting aye; noes, none.

VARIANCE (V-18-58)	The Commission considered the application of C.L. Hennon for a variance

C.L. Hennon	to process mineral rich soil by grinding with a small machine, packaging

and storing same for two years, if possible, at property located on the
Referred back to Board                  east side of Pecos, approximately 300 feet north of East Charleston Blvd.
of Zoning Adjustment	legally described as the W½ of the SW¼, of Government Lot #4, in Section

31, T20S, R62E, MDB&M, Excepting therefrom the west 175 feet of the south
305 feet thereof, and the west 140 feetof the east 155 feet of the north 142.5 feet thereof, 

in an R-E zone. Denial recommended by the Board of Zoning Adjustment. There
are six protests.

12-17-58
Mr. Hennon appeared before the Board with samples of the enriched
soil he wishes to produce. He also suggested an alternate location
on the north side of East Charleston just east of Pecos. A Mr. James
Ettling and a Mr. Swapp stepped forward to voice their protests to

of the property in question.

His Honor: Mayor Baker asked if the City has the authority to condemn on the basis of the
appraisal and Commissioner Fountain asked how much the appraisal would be. City Manager

$400.00. Commissioner Bunker recommended that if proceedings are instigated that they should
be followed through and not go to this expense and get half way through with it and then drop
it. Mr. Kennedy said that we should get the appraisal so we can put it into next year's budget.

Hinson and the cost of this installation would be about $7,000.00. County Commissioner Harmon
is going to take this same matter up with the Board of County Commissioners. As to the lighting
of the corner with street lights and running them from Hyde Park, in the over-all program,
we would be better off to keep the circuits separate.

of Equalization, and that inasmuch as it was his understanding that the representation should
Appointment	be rotated between the Cities that he recommended that Commissioner Harris P. Sharp be

Commissioner Whipple moved that Commissioner Harris P. Sharp be appointed to serve on
	the Clark County Board of Equalization.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Fountain, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Commissioner Sharp passed his vote.

GAMING APPLICATIONS	The Commission considered the application of S. R. Kennard, and M. W. Fortney doing business

Additional	as the Bird Cage, 102 Fremont for 3 Racehorse Keno games, Attorney William Morse spoke to

Bird Cage	the Board, representing the applicants, stating that the application is for 3 Racehorse

Keno Games in addition to the one they already have, making a total of four altogether. Mr.
Held in Abeyance	Morse showed the Commission a sample of the ticket which is designated in four sections and

the player can mark one, two, three or four games Whichever he chooses to play. He further
explained that there would be four light-up boards and, in other words, four games can
actually be played at one time.

He stated they went to the Gaming Control Board of the State to see if this was a legal
proposition and the State Board gave them the green light to go ahead with their plans
and have issued them a license for 4 Racehorse Keno Games. He said the City Officials
told them there was nothing legally wrong with having the 4 Keno Games if the Board of
City Commissioners approved it. So they went ahead and remodeled the club; having spent
$54,000.00 in doing so. He stated they would like to open before the Holidays and get
their personnel used to running the games.

12-17-58
Mr. Morse continued stating that they had met with the Chief of Police and City
Manager a couple of days ago and reviewedjthe operation of the game with them. He
said that Mr. Kennard and Mr. Fortney have spent considerable money on the original
building of the Bird Cage and have spent a lot of money keeping the doors open and
the whole venture has hot been too successful. They have sustained a loss of
$450,000.00. The remodelling and setting-up of the four Keno games has been done
with secrecy because they wanted to be the originators of the $100,000.00, 4-in-one
Keno. They are not increasing the pay-off of any combination of numbers, only
difference is the player can play 4-in-one and it makes a speeded up game. They do
not intend to have misleading advertising.

Mr. Ashworth took the floor to further explain that there were to be four separate
boards, red, orange, white and blue and a player could play any number of games,

1, 2, 3 or 4. And that the casino would consist of these 4 Racehorse Keno Games,
slot machines, bar and restaurant.

Commissioner Fountain stated he resented the fact that other persons said such an
operation would be all right. City Manager Kennedy said that he asked Chief Sheffer to
have the applicants come to his office to have a meeting and that when he asked them
if they realized the final approval was up to the Board of City Commissioners they said
that they did realize this.

Commissioner Whipple stated that this puts the Board on the spot. The major problem
we have is someone with a new idea or a new gimmick and if it doesn't work then we have
problems with it. Now, money has been spent and if the licenses are not approved to be
issued the Board will be blamed and it would be difficult for us to be put in that position.
The Board could have further problems along this line in the future.



Attorney Morse suggested that if the application for 3 Racehorse Keno Games was approved
that the Commission could cut them back to two or one games if they should see fit. He
stated that the gambling business is a highly competitive proposition right now in any of
the downtown Casinos or on the Strip. In order to compete with the larger establishments
this was an idea to stimulate business. It may fall flat on its face and then again it
may catch on. They would certainly like for the Board to see fit to approve it so they
could try it.

           Commissioner Fountain stated that when they open with this someone else on Fremont will
	 come out with something different too. Commissioner Sharp stated that he appreciated the

                                                           fact that the applicants were trying to make this a paying proposition. Commissioners
                                                           Fountain continued with the statement that they would agree that this gambling has to be
	controlled. And this might create a monster down there that could not be controlled. 

                                                           Attorney Morse stated that if it was found that this could not be controlled, the licenses could 

be revoked (called back). In answer to this the Commissioners were in

agreement that this would be out of the question and would entail a "show cause" order and
a lot of other steps.

Mr. Ashworth suggested perhaps the Commission would be willing to table this application
and give it more thought and maybe the Commissioners would like to stop in at the Bird
Cage and see the set-up.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the application of S. R. Kennard and M. W. Fortney doing
business as the Bird Cage, 102 Fremont, for 3 Racehorse Keno Games be held in abeyance.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

                                                          Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

USE PERMIT (U-17-58)	The Commission again took up the consideration of the application of the Greater Faith

Greater Faith Baptist Church	Baptist Church for a Use Permit to construct a church at 1026 Highland Drive, on the southeast

	 corner of	Highland and Jefferson, legally described as a portion of the NW¼, SW¼, NE¼,

Approved	

At this time Reverend P. S. Walker spoke to the Board stating that when they told the
Board they intended to build a church worth $125,000.00 that that didn't mean it was going
to actually cost them that much. He went on to say that they were going to build the
church in sections 20' x 60' and they have all the necessary funds, material and labor
to complete this first section and the construction will be of brick and steel reinforced
concrete. He stated that they have their own bricklayers, plumber and electrician and
also that they have 900 other fellow-craftsmen to help with the other work involved. He
stated that they have all the necessary pledges and that if they don't get anything from
anybody else they can complete their first section. He said that they were not going to
build an eyesore or anything detrimental to the neighborhood — they are going to build a
beautiful building.

Commissioner Sharp asked if it was their intention to build the church in sections and the
Reverend replied in the affirmative explaining that each section will be complete and when
they get through it will all be under one covering. He stated that they intend to occupy
the first section within 45 days after they dig the foundation. He informed the Board
that there is a balance of around $800.00 on the land which they will finish paying for
in installments so they can use their cash to build the first section of the church. He
stated they are going to abide by the law and will stand up to the City inspection.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the application of the Greater Faith Baptist Church for a
use permit to construct a church at 1026 Highland Drive, on the southeast corner of Highland
and Jefferson, legally described as a portion of the NW¼, SW¼, SW¼, NE¼, Section 28, T20S,
R6lE, in an R-E zone, be approved.

LAS VEGAS DAY NURSERY         At this time His Honor Mayor Baker, requested the City Clerk to read the following letter
SCHOOL	dated January 2, 1959, which was addressed to City Manager Kennedy from Edward Young for

Request for purchase                or the Las Vegas Day Nursery School:
lease of City property

January 2, 1959

A. H. Kennedy, City Manager
City Hall
400 Stewart Avenue
Las Vegas, Nevada

Dear Mr. Kennedy:

In accordance with previous, conversations, request is made herewith on
behalf of the Las Vegas Day Nursery School, a non-profit Nevada corporation,
for 2½ acres, more or less, approximating ½ of the following described
property:

A certain tract or parcel of land lying and being within
the City of Las Vegas, County of Clark, State of Nevada,
and being a portion of the SE¼ of the NW¼ of Section 26
T20S, R61E, MDB&M - generally described as follows to-wit:

The N 411.56 ft. of the S 761.27 ft. of the E 574.81 ft.
of the SE¼ of the NW-y¼ of Section 26 - 20 61 MDB&M. Less
those portions reserved or dedicated for Public Right of
Way and Utilities purpose. Containing 5.15 acres, more
or less.

I sincerely regret any inconvenience or misunderstanding from failure to receive
our request before this. It had been my impression that such a request had been
sent.

Our organization has been established for the purpose of making available child
care facilities for pre-school and school age children of working parents. When
this land is made available to us on a long term lease or purchase arrangement,
we plan to undertake a campaign to raise funds through a joint effort of the 
interested parents and various community service organizations to construct facilities
suitable for this program.

We have not, as yet, had time to formulate any detailed campaign, as we had hoped,
until recently, that some single organization would undertake this construction
for us. However, there is no question as to the need for such a facility in this
city, and we feel certain that it will receive sufficient public support as to
enable us to start construction within some reasonable period of time.

We look forward to your early response.	Yours very truly

1-7-59	/s/ Edward Young
Mr. Young spoke to the Commissioners stating that he had appeared before the Board on
this matter before on the subject of a child care center. At that time they had had
hopes that Variety or some other organization would build the building for them but
this has not been made possible. He stated that since the closing of the Las Vegas Day
Nursery School a great hardship has been imposed on the working parents in this City.

These parents have to have someone to take care of their children while'they work at a
cost they can afford to pay.

The Commercial Day Nursery Rates are $3.00 per day minimum per child, and at this 
prohibitive cost it would be necessary for these parents to quit work and go on relief
and they wish to avoid this. However, they do feel that if they are not confronted with
the expense of the land that good people will provide the funds to build instead of going
to the City, County or State to provide such a nursery home and the fees would be based
on a sliding scale of ability to pay Mr. Young suggested that perhaps the United Fund

would supplement the money needed to carry on such an establishment.

Commissioner Fountain asked if there was a need for 2½ acres and Mr. Young replied that
the more space they have the more room there would be for recreational facilities.
Commissioner Fountain asked what the appraised price is on this property in question, and
City Manager Kennedy advised that when the City sold a parcel of this land to the Eagles
Lodge it was $2,000.00 per acres and they paid $10,000.00 for the five acres.

Commissioner Fountain stated that he did not think the City would be in a position to
lease this property when they are going into competition with other nurseries and suggested
an outright sale of the appraised value. Mr. Young stated that it would be necessary for
them to get into a fund raising campaign to buy the property and to build the building and
that will take a lot of time.

Commissioner Sharp suggested that a down payment be made on this property to hold it.
Commissioner Fountain stated he would like to stretch the time out for them for payment
as a purchase and not as a lease. City Attorney Hawkins said this could be done. Mayor
Baker made mention of the fact that there are no utilities out there, water or sewer,
and Mr. Young said it was his understanding a subdivider is laying out the adjacent area.

Mayor Baker stated that heretofore in considering matters such as this, the Board requests
any organization to furnish them with plans and estimates for anything they want to do
which is necessary to analyze the success of it. He further stated that it is not a
function of the City to provide child care and this proposition is competitive to a certain
extent and we are reluctant to lease property for this purpose as it is a commercial
business. Other groups may come in, equally as worthy, as a civic need. He did not know
what they expected from the Commission at this meeting as actually there is nothing before
us.

Mr. Young answered that the request is in regard to this piece of property in question.

The Mayor suggested that the City could hold the ground for than and Mr. Young suggested
holding it for them for six months to enable them to make an outright purchase and at that
time they would have plans for specifically what they wish to do. Commissioner Bunker
reminded them that an expenditure will be involved to bring in the utilities. The 
Commission agreed to hold this property for them for six months.

GAMING APPLICATIONS	The Commission again considered the application of S. R. Kennard and M. W. Fortney doing

Additional	business as the Bird Cage, 102 Fremont for 3 Racehorse Keno games. This application was

Bird Cage	held in abeyance at the last regular meeting of the Board of City Commissioners held

December 17, 1958. Attorney William Morse, representing the applicants, appeared before
Denied	the Board requesting a decision so the operators can either go ahead with the new set-up

or revert back to the former operation of the single Keno game.

An employee of the Bird Cage, Gilbert Smith, spoke from the floor stating that he would
like to know what his future would be as an employee, as he understood the Bird Cage could
not continue operation without these additional licenses. Mayor Baker stated that the
attitude of the Board, at least his attitude, was that they were skeptical in operation of
games that might tend to affect the gambling situation in general both in the City and the
State. Another employee, Robert Hutchins, stated that he understood that the State had
issued the license for all four racehorse Keno games. A George Conrad, another employee
asked what the difference is between having four crap tables or having four racehorse
Keno games. Commissioner Whipple stated that it was a matter of policy of this Board.

Attorney Morse stated that he wanted the Board to know that he was not responsible for the
 appearance of	these gentlemen and that for their information the club	is not going	to close.

If these additional licenses are not granted, the operators will take	out this new	setup and

operate as they did before.

Commissioner Whipple moved that the application of S. R. Kennard and M. W. Fortney doing
business as the Bird Cage, 102 Fremont for 3 Racehorse Keno Games be denied.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Officer William B.	a 30-day extension of sick leave for Officer William B. Foster, who on December 17, 1958,

Foster	had an operation resulting in the removal of two-thirds of his stomach. Officer Foster's sick

LAS VEGAS SPORTS CAR             City Manager Kennedy presented a petition of the Board of Directors of the Las Vegas Sports
CLUB PETITION	Car Club to lease a parcel of land adjacent to North 2nd Street between West Bonanza and the

American Legion and to move an 8' x 20' building, now located in the County, on to the land
Approved	they request to lease.

Mr. Kennedy explained that this site would be used for the club's meetings twice a month and
mostly it is to be used for storage. They say they will clean up the area if the City would
see fit to lease this land to them. The suggested terms are a one-year basis at $1.00 per year
with option to renew it and eventually they wish to build a new building on it. The building
they request to move to this location was originally build inside the City and met with the
code at that time. There is no plumbing or water in this building.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the request of the Las Vegas Sports Car Club to lease a parcel
of land adjacent to North 2nd Street between West Bonanza and the American Legion on a one-
year basis at $1.00 per year with option to renew it, and to move their 8' x 20' building onto

matters that they called deficiencies that we are penalized on.

1-7-59
We should be able to complete our studies on this within the next ten to fifteen days
so that we may correct anything that is not of an effect that it is going to cost additional
funds and advise them or our stand on some of these and ask for a recheck or a new grading
on the points that have been corrected. Our biggest deficiencies show Water System, many
of these which we will have to work out with the Water District. City Manager stated the
City was 219 points from a Class 3 and it is his belief that we can reduce a number of these
points and that he has talked with the Main Office of the City Manager Association and they
will go along with us.

CITY ATTORNEY APPOINTMENT

His Honor Mayor Baker opened the meeting with the statement that this was a Call of a
Special Meeting and at this time he would like to turn the gavel over to Mayor Pro Tem Whipple
and nominate Calvin Cory for City Attorney.

Commissioner Fountain asked if there had been any discussion as to a second man. Mayor Pro
Tem Whipple stated that there had been no official discussion and that he had proposed the
name of Jack Pursel the other day when Commissioner Sharp was here but the meeting did not
materialize.

Mayor Baker stated that he might qualify his nomination by adding that he had no objection to
Jack Pursel but that he felt Mr. Cory would more adequately serve as City Attorney due to his
past experience.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple said that he would like to turn the gavel back to Mayor Baker and
nominate Jack Pursel for City Attorney.

Commissioner Fountain said that they were going to have to move in some direction on this
appointment and stated that Calvin Cory was acceptable to him and asked if he was appointed
if his term would be for the unexpired term of the City Attorney. City Attorney Hawkins
stated that in his opinion the appointment at this time would be for the unexpired term of
the City Attorney unless the legislature made a charter change.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple stated that there didn't seem to be a second for either one of the
nominations and suggested each write a name on a piece of paper and put it in a hat; then he
asked if anyone else had any other suggestions.

Commissioner Fountain asked if there had been any mention as to who the assistant will be.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple was of the opinion that the appointment of a City Attorney should be
made and the matter of the deputy left to the City Attorney and the City Manager.

Mayor Baker stated that they were apparently at an impasse. Commissioner Fountain asked if he
would be allowed to second either of these nominations. City Attorney Hawkins advised that a
second was not necessary. Commissioner Bunker suggested they call for a vote.

Commissioner Fountain seconded the nomination of Calvin Cory. He added that he thought they
were both good men but that Mr. Cory was more experienced. Motion was carried by the following
vote:	Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, and His Honor Mayor Baker voting aye; noes, none. Mayor

Pro Tem Whipple voted aye but stated that he would like to qualify his vote so that the record
would show that his first choice was Jack Pursel; however, he voted to make the appointment
unanimous.

Commissioner Fountain suggested that they contact Harris Sharp by telephone right away. Mayor
Pro Tem Whipple said that Commissioner Sharp had stated that either one of these two men would
be acceptable to him. Commissioner Bunker said that he thought they should get Commissioner

RELOCATION OF HOUSING	The Commission again considered the request for authorization to move a Housing Authority

AUTHORITY BUILDING	Building on to City	Property located west of the	railroad	tracks; the building to be	brought

up to code and made	available for the use of the	Salvation Army as their Shelter.

(Note: Continued from

earlier in meeting)	Bud Swanson introduced Sr. Major Harold L. Nadeau, Officer in Charge of the Salvation Army,

	who explained that this shelter has been maintained at the old Welfare Administration Building

Salvation Army Shelter	behind the City Shops and that last year they received notice that they would have to vacate

this location just as soon as possible due to the fact that the proposed freeway would be
coming through there. The Major explained that they house some twenty to thirty a night and
serve between 800 to 1300 meals a week at the Shelter, and there is no question that it is
an asset to the City of Las Vegas as it would be a problem to the Police Department to care
for these people.

1-21-59
He stated that the Salvation Army had planned a capital campaign but set that aside due
to the organizing of the United Fund Drive. They have not been successful in raising these
 funds and they have contacted the Housing Authority and this building has been made available.
He requested the City to give the Salvation Army a long-term lease on the property located
north of Bonanza Road and West of the railroad tracks.

Bud Swanson again spoke to the Commission stating that the United Fund officials had met
with the Salvation Army and the Housing Authority who has offered to donate the recently
vacated nursery building now located in Kelso Turner. What they would like to know is if
it would be possible for the facilities of the City, in conjunction with the County, to move
and set up this building for the Salvation Army Shelter. He further stated that he felt they
could get sufficient support from the labor organizations to do the necessary work to bring
the building up to code once it is relocated. He stated the United Fund would be able to
furnish the money to buy the necessary materials that will be needed.

Director of Public Works Sauer stated that he had seen this building which they propose to
have moved only from a distance and it was his opinion that it would cost between two and
three thousand dollars to bring it up to code after it is moved. He further stated that
the City does have the type of equipment necessary to move the building and he did not know
what the County might have.

After some discussion it was the opinion of the Commission that the Salvation Army Shelter
serves a very worthwhile purpose and that the City should participate in some way to help
with this project, and this matter was referred to the City Manager for investigation and
report as to the cost of moving the building and bringing it up to code and preparation of
the suggested long-term lease for the new site of the building.

RELEASE OF PRISONER	City Manager Kennedy presented a letter from Charles V. Main, Chief of Police, Frederick,

Larry Lord Matherwell	Maryland, to the Chief of Police in Las Vegas, requesting the release of Larry Lord Motherwell,

GENERAL STREET & DRAINAGE           General street and drainage plan for the SE¼ of the NW¼, Section 2, T21S, R61E,

PLAN	generally described as that area between Franklin and Bracken Avenue and 15th and

Smitley & Blasco Property                  17th Streets, has been prepared jointly by the Planning and Engineering Departments

in accordance with the directive of the City Commission at their regular meeting
Approved	held January 7, 1959, and presents a street pattern that is acceptable both from a

drainage and traffic flow viewpoint.

The Planning Commission approved the plan after Paul Smitley and Joseph Blasco,
principal property owners and applicants for subdivision, advised the Planning 
Commission that they were in agreement with the proposed plan.

Director of Planning Franklin J. Bills stated that this matter is before the City
Commission for approval as a general plan, not as a subdivision. Subsequent 
subdivision plans would have to coincide with this plan, if it is adopted. He stated
it will provide for proper drainage in the area and includes the easement for the
Blasco property.

Commissioner Whipple moved that the general street and drainage plan for the SE¼ of
NW¼, Section 2, T21S, R61E, generally described as that area between Franklin and
Bracken Avenues and 15th and 17th Streets, as prepared by the Planning and Engineering
Department be approved.

ABANDONMENT - TONOPAH	Petition of property owners and letter from the Clark County School District re-

DRIVE BETWEEN WASHINGTON	questing vacation of Tonopah Drive between Washington and Fair Avenues which separates

& FAIR AVENUES	School District property in Bonanza Village and Twin Lakes Village Unit #6, which

the School District proposed to use as a functional unit. Due to the fact that there
(Cont'd later in these	are several utility lines in this right-of-way, and that it also serves as a drainage

minutes)	channel for a limited area, the Planning Commission feels that it is inadvisable to

vacate this portion of the street.

As an alternative, the Planning Commission recommends that this portion of Tonopah
Drive be abandoned as a traffic-way subject to a stipulation that the Clark County
School District remove existing curbs and install new curbs and additional paving
on Mezpah Street between Washington and Fair, and on Fair Avenue between Mezpah and
Tonopah Drive, to provide for a 60' right-of-way with a 50' curb-to-curb paving, in
accordance with approved city standards and specifications for a collector street.

It was requested the Commission set a date for a Public Hearing as required by State
Law.

There is a petition on file in the City Clerk's Office protesting the closing of
this street and also a letter from the Las Vegas Valley Water District opposing this
action.

Mr. George E. Harris, Assistant Superintendent of the Clark County School District was
present and Commissioner Whipple asked him if the School Board had considered selling
the property in Twin Lakes Village Unit #6 and buying the property to the north of
Bonanza School and then it would not be necessary to close Tonopah Drive. He stated
that if Tonopah Drive was closed it would be necessary in cases of emergency for
police cars and fire trucks to go around Tonopah Drive and that this would not be
good planning.

Mr. Harris replied that they had not considered the property to the north inasmuch
as it was their understanding that the plan to eventually close Tonopah had the approval
of the Planning Commission and the City Commission at the time of the approval of Twin
Lakes Village Unit #6 subdivision, and they did not anticipate any controversy when the
time came to develop this area for use of the school.

Mr. Harris made reference to his letter of November 10, 1955 to Planning Director
Franklin Bills wherein this plan was outlined, and asked if this was impossible for
good planning, to let them know and they would have to make some other arrangement
for school site selection, and it was indicated at that time that this street could
be vacated or closed when the school expanded.

2-4-59
Mr. Harris stated that he believed the property to the north is rather narrow as
compared to the property west across Tonopah and would not be as well suited. 
Commissioner Bunker asked what was the difference in the sizes and Mr. Bills estimated
the land to the north was approximately 400' in depth whereas the land in Twin Lakes
Village Unit #6 was approximately 200' in depth.

Mrs. William W. Brown, owner of the property on the northeast Conner of Tonopah Drive
and Washington Avenue and one of the objectors to the closing of Tonopah Drive, spoke
to the Board stating that the property to the west would be reduced more if the
street plan of 60' was met.

Commissioner Whipple stated that Tonopah Drive is to be very important as more 
developing is done to the north and suggested that between now and the public hearing
the possible procurement of the property to the north be investigated to see what
can be done.

Director of Planning, Mr. Franklin Bills, stated that he would like to make the position
of the Planning Department clear, and that when the tentative map of Twin Lakes Village
Unit #6 was approved by the Planning Commission and subsequently the City Commission
on December 7, 1955, there was a clear understanding that in order to make Block #1 of
Twin Lakes Village #6 useable to the School District, it would be necessary to eventually 
close that portion of Tonopah Drive which separates the two properties.

He further stated that he could clearly recall explaining this point in detail to
both the Planning Commission and City Commission and recommending at that time that
Twin Lakes Village Unit #6 should not be approved in its present design unless the
Planning Commission and City Commission were completely agreed upon a subsequent closure
of this portion of Tonopah Drive.

He explained it was his understanding at that time that, after weighing the benefits of
a collector street against the benefits to the school system, it was agreed that the
closure could be made without creating exceptional problems. He stated that he did not
say then, and he does not say now, that curving the traffic path around the school is
the ideal street design for this area; however, he does not feel that it creates a
totally bad situation and can see no real difference between the pattern which would thus
be created from the one which presently exists on South 10th Street as it bends around
the John S. Park School.

At this time the subject of this discussion was discontinued to be brought up later in
the meeting as the City Attorney had to do some legal checking.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent:	Commissioner

Fountain.

A Mr. Staples spoke to the Commission stating that he would not want his children
to have to go on half day sessions due to the inability of the Bonanza School to
go ahead with their expansion program. He was in favor of the closing of Tonopah
Drive and suggested the of this street during school hours and having

it open at other times.

Gary Kissel, another property owner in favor of the closing of Tonopah Drive, spoke
with regard to the delay which would be caused in the expansion of the building at
the Bonanza School and His Honor Mayor Baker explained to him that it is a matter
of law that this notice of not less than 30 days or more than 40 days	be given.

Mr. William Brown, an objector to the closing of Tonopah, stated that he was not

against the enlargement of the school and asked why argue about building when
ground in question is for playground area. Mr. Harris of the School District 
explained that they expect to be building additional class rooms on the east side of
Tonopah Drive. He mentioned the experience they have had in the past in acquiring
property and the time element involved; however, he stated that the possibilities
of purchasing the property to the north would be investigated.

Mrs. William Brown spoke stating that they do own the property on the corner and

on the schools original map it showed no home but a power transformer and a part

of their property belonging to the Power Company and they are protesting the
abandonment of Tonopah Drive as it will block them off from ingress and egress to
their property in the manner in which it has always been and in the way the 
buildings on their property are facing.

SET-BACK REQUIREMENTS	Request of Mr. Robert Brooks to amend Ordinance No. 659 Master Plan of Streets and

South 2nd between	Highways so that South 2nd between Wyoming and Oakey Blvd. is not designated as a

Wyoming and Oakey	major street and set-back of 40' from center line of the right-of-way would no

Robert Brooks	longer be required.

Approved	At the Commission meeting of December 3, 1958, this request was referred to the

Planning Commission. At the Commission meeting held December 17, 1958, the Planning
Commission recommended that no change be made in ordinance no. 659 and as an
alternative recommended the vacation or abandonment of South 2nd Street; from
Wyoming to Oakey and to improve Wyoming to make a workable traffic movement from
South 2nd through Wyoming on to South 5th Street. At this City Commission meeting
motion was made to hold this matter in abeyance. The Planning Commission 
recommendation still stands as heretofore stated.

Planning Director Bills advised the Board that 2nd Street from Bonanza to Oakey as
a secondary street requires a 40' setback from the center line and that is the way
it is all the way to Wyoming; however; there is only a 32½' setback between Wyoming
and Oakey due to a vacation in 1948. The Traffic Department states that there is
a bad situation at Oakey and Wyoming in that there is such a short distance between
there and South 5th. He further stated that one Motel owner feels that it would be
bad for his business if this portion of South 2nd was vacated.

Attorney Louis Wiener; Jr.; spoke for his client; Mr. Brooks; stating that Mr.

Brooks has no objection to the vacating of the street and he would still build
7%-' from the present curb line; however; he is desirous of one plan or the other
being approved by the City Commission; and it appeared to Mr. Wiener that one or
the other of the moves would be favorable.

Mr. Bridgman spoke to the Commission stating that he owned the property where the
Jackpot Motel is located at South 2nd and Wyoming and that his $8,000.00 worth of
neon signs now show over to 5th St. He objected to the vacationing of the street
as he felt it would greatly reduce his business.

Attorney Wiener stated that he did not see how South 2nd Street could be a through
street as it couldn't go through Market Town. Mr. Christensen spoke from the
audience stating that he uses 2nd Street a lot and has seen traffic almost as
heavy as that on 5th Street. It was his opinion that a great deal of traffic turns
off 5th Street on Oakey and then turns down 2nd Street.

Commissioner Bunker stated that he would be opposed to vacating this portion of
the street and would be in favor of changing the setback and allowing the 7½" sidewalk.
Commissioner Whipple agreed with Commissioner Bunker and said that he would approve
allowing them to build up to 7½" from the curb. Commissioner Bunker was of the
opinion that the builder was certainly entitled to an answer and felt the Commission
should act upon this matter at this meeting.

Commissioner Bunker moved that the request of Mr. Robert Brooks to amend Ordinance
No. 659 Master Plan of Streets and Highways so that South 2nd Street between Wyoming
Avenue and Oakey Boulevard is not designated as a major street and reduce the set-
back of 40' from the center line of the right-of-way to 32½', be approved; and the
City Attorney be instructed to prepare the amending ordinance.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Bunker; Sharp; Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes; none. Absent:	Commissioner

Fountain.

HADLAND PARK SPRINKLING             Informal bids were received on February 3, 1959; for materials for the extension of

SYSTEM	the Sprinkling System at Hadland Park. It was recommended by the Engineering Department

Sprinkler Sales & Service                    that the award be made to the Sprinkler Sales and Service Co., P. 0. Box 2407, Las

Vegas, for the low bid in the amount of $1,223.22. His Honor Mayor Baker asked if this
Award	firm was properly licensed with the City and Director of Public Works Sauer replied in

the affirmative and stated they were connected with the Ace Plumbing and Heating Company.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the contract for materials for the extension of the
sprinkling system at Hadland Park be awarded to the Sprinkler Sales and Service Co.,

P. 0. Box 2407, Las Vegas, for the low bid in the amount of $1,223.22.

SLURRY EMULSION	Engineering Department requests that authorization he given to advertise for bids to

Request to advertise	be opened March 4, 1959; for slurry emulsion. It is estimated that 700 tons of SS-2

bids to be opened	slurry emulsion for use during the period from April 1, 1959 to September 30, 1959,

March 4, 1959	will be required in the total estimated cost of $24,500.00. All bidders will be 

required to submit their laboratory analysis.

Referred to Public Works

Commissioner Bunker stated that he was of the opinion that the Slurry program was not
doing the job it should do and that the City was spending good money for bad.

Director of Public Works Sauer stated that this slurry coating could be done at a
cost of 7 cents per square yard and that it is not a paving but is a preventative
to keep present surface from going to pieces until permanent paving can be put in.

Mr. H. W. Polk spoke from the audience stating that he would like to see the cost at
7 cents per square yard. He further stated that the City could get something that
would hold up and that the actual cost to maintain should be installed on these
streets.

His Honor Mayor Baker stated that slurry is handled for maintenance problems and AC
would mean new construction and would have to go into an assessment district. He
would agree that it is no good where heavy traffic is concerned.

Commissioner Bunker stated that in some instances slurry has been of some help but
that in other instances it has been of no value whatsoever. He suggested that certain
streets be selected for slurry coat but was of the opinion that it should not be used
on those that are too far gone. Commissioner Whipple agreed that the slurry has
helped some but not on the heavily travelled streets.

Mr. Sauer stated that the cost would be 90 cents a square yard for AC Paving and
that he would be glad to show Mr. Polk the City's figures showing slurry at 7 cents
per square yard.

His Honor Mayor Baker suggested that the Department of Public Works analyze this
situation a little and recommend certain streets for slurry and some for AC. He
further suggested that a map be prepared showing the proposed planning of street
repair.

RELOCATION OF HOUSING	At the regular meeting of the Board of City Commissioners held January 21, 1959, the

AUTHORITY BUILDING	Board considered the request of the Salvation Army in regard to the moving of a

Salvation Army Shelter	Housing Authority Building on to City property located north of Bonanza Road and west

of the railroad tracks which they propose to lease.

Report

The Housing Authority has offered to donate the recently vacated nursery building now
located in Kelso Turner for use as the Salvation Army Shelter.

This Shelter has been maintained at the old Welfare Administration Building behind
the City Shops and last year the Salvation Army received notice that they would have
to vacate this location as soon as possible due to the fact that the proposed freeway
would be coming through there.

At the meeting of January 21, 1959, Bud Swanson of the United Fund asked the Commission
if it would be possible for the facilities of the City, in conjunction with the County,
to move and set up this building for the Salvation Army Shelter. He further stated that
he felt they could get sufficient support from the labor organizations to do the
necessary work to bring the building up to code once it is relocated. Director of
Public Works Sauer stated that the City does not have this type of moving equipment
After some discussion the opinion of the Commission was that the City should 
participate in some way to help with this worthwhile project and the matter was referred to
the City Manager for investigation and report.

City Manager Kennedy reported to the Board that it would cost approximately $3,400.00
to have the building moved to the new location and suggested that this low bid which
was obtained from a local moving concern be considered. An estimated total cost of
$13,300.00 would cover all material, labor and the moving of the building. It might
be possible to get some better prices and help which would reduce this total cost. He
further stated that the County Commission is also considering this proposition at their
meeting and this matter will again be presented at the next Board of Commissioners
Meeting.

PETITION	City Manager Kennedy reported to the Board that a petition from property owners residing

Reduce Speed on Beverly	on Beverly Way between San Francisco and St. Louis Avenues requesting that raised berms

Way	be placed on the surface of Beverly Way in order to slow up traffic.

The Traffic Engineer has checked this area using radar equipment and could find no
excessive speeding. Several petitioners were contacted to determine the approximate
time of the speeding and these hours were checked with the same results. It would
appear that the major portion of the speeding has stopped; however, speed checks will
be continued in the area.

It is recommended that no berms be placed in the street, not only this street but any
street, to slow down traffic, due to the liability that would be automatically placed
on the City for any accident caused by somebody hitting on these berms.

VOTING MACHINES	City Manager Kennedy read the proposed resolution for the use of Voting Machines in the

Request for use in 1959	1959 Municipal Elections and requested that this resolution be adopted. He further

Municipal Elections	requested that one of the Commissioners be appointed to serve with the Chief of Police

of the City of Las Vegas as duly authorized officials to inspect the voting machines.

Adopted

Mrs. Giancontieri spoke from the audience asking what if there would he a break-down
in the machines and further stated that she would not be denied her right to vote.

Mr. Kennedy explained that all the electrical circuits at the polling places will be
checked and that he believed that there would be no trouble experienced with the voting
machines in this election and that there would be maintenance men available.

Commissioner Whipple moved that Commissioner Sharp be appointed to serve with the Chief
of Police as duly authorized officials to inspect the voting machines and the following
resolution be adopted and order made:

available to the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, one hundred (100) Shoup Voting Machines for

Bridger and Lewis on 15th                   Street and Bridger and 15th Street and Lewis for installation of street lights on those
Street	corners. The Engineering Department estimated that the cost for these installations

lights down in that area. The circuit would have to be brought in from Carson Street.

It is recommended that one new light be installed.

Mr. Kennedy further stated that 15th Street is to come under a street widening program
in the near future and it was suggested that temporary lights be installed until such
time as the street widening program is started.

A City Employee by the name of Mr. G. W. Contner, Captain from the Fire Department,

410 South 16th Street, spoke to the Commission regarding the need for street lights
in this entire area. He mentioned that it is very dark and that it has been necessary
to have police down there and that it is not safe for their women or children to go
out after dark. He stated that the people there pay as much taxes as anyone and
asked why they could not get proper street lighting installed. He mentioned his
neighbor Dean Burlingame has told him that it is necessary to know somebody to get
these petitions circulated around.

Mr. Kennedy explained to him that this would have to be put in as a street light
assessment and petition would have to be signed by 51 percent of the property owners
in the area and that the City Attorney would assist them as to the form to use for
the petition and also would answer any other questions that they might have.

quality of entertainment furnished in the past; and

Acting City Clerk

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent:	Commissioner

Fountain.

His Honor Mayor Baker read a letter dated February 2, 1959, front Commissioner E. W.

Fountain wherein he requested that it be spread upon the minutes that he is in favor
of this proposed resolution and that it be indicated at the time of its consideration
that if he had been present and voting he would have voted aye.

-0O0-

At this time the Mayor asked if there was any other business to come before the Commission
and Mr. H. W. Polk took the floor stating that he was very much perturbed in regard to the
City of Las Vegas doing new construction work. He went on to say that the City takes
their Bonds and License Fees and then allows the City Forces to do new work and to do work not
up to the City's own specification. Namely, he mentioned Highland Avenue and Bruce Street
which was surfaced with material the City will not allow contractors to use. He stated that
he would like to know just what is the policy of the City.

His Honor Mayor Baker stated that there is a story behind Highland and Bruce Street. He
said that the policy of this Board is to let contracts to contractors and to use City
Forces for maintenance purposes in the main, and that the City does not propose to get
into anything of a competitive nature with those people who are licensed and contractors.

He further stated that whatever the City does it is up to standard.

Mrs. Christensen spoke in regard to the cutting through of Highland from Bonanza to
Charleston to alleviate under-pass.

Mr. Kennedy stated that the second barrel of Charleston will be started this year.

His Honor Mayor Baker stated that right-of-way for second barrel of Bonanza is also being
Negotiated.

Mr. Bill Carter, of the Teamsters Union, spoke to the Board stating that the City is doing
more and more of its own construction work. He had thought this was a temporary situation
and he would like to meet with the Mayor and Board of Commissioners and explain their position
and point out some of their problems.

2-4-59
His Honor Mayor Baker explained that if there were specific problems that they should
have them ready to present and the Board would be glad to meet on it. He stated that
he deplored these criticisms without specific instances.

Mr. Carter again spoke to the Board stating that it is their responsibility to secure
as much work for their employees as they can.

His Honor Mayor Baker stated that he thought it is the desire of the Board to make
available as much work as possible and stay out of the private construction business.

He stated there may have been infractions but he did not believe it is as serious
as they might think and he was sure it could be explained.

Mr. Jim Arnold, Secretary, Southern Nevada Building and Trades Councils, addressed
	the Board and said that they would certainly appreciate appearing before them with

actual facts and see if some of the difficulties could be ironed out.

Mayor Baker suggested that they contact City Manager Kennedy about a time for a
meeting.

Commissioner Bunker asked if the same request is going to be made of the County.

Mayor Baker added "and with other Cities of the County and the State of Nevada and
other quasi-governmental agencies."



There being no further business to come before the Board, at the hour of 10:20 P.M.
Commissioner Bunker moved this meeting adjourn.

bring it up to code would be $13,300.00 The City Clerk read a letter received from the
United Fund of Clark County, Inc., dated February 16, 1959.

$6,000.00 for the moving and relocating the building on a cement slab floor would be
the top in total cost to be divided between the City and County. City Manager Kennedy
said that when he talked with them the other day, that it was his impression that the
County and City were going to pay the $3,400.00 for the moving of the building. He
stated he thought the City could share $1700.00 for their half.

Commissioner Fountain stated that he believed this shelter should be provided for.

Mr. Boman spoke again stating that the United Fund and Salvation Army will also have
to secure the $7,300.00 to bring the building up to code, but that they felt this has
to be taken care of and it might be that the cost would not run as high as estimated.

City Attorney Calvin Cory recommended that a lease be drawn and executed before the
moving of this building commences. City Manager Kennedy stated that Mr. Gerson of
the Housing Authority has a contract to tear this building down and is waiting to see
how the Salvation Army comes out with this plan of moving the building. Mr. Boman
stated that he assumed Harry Levy is in contact with Mr. Gerson and that he will wait
until this plan is worked out.

Commissioner Sharp stated that he was willing to go along with the plan if the County
is willing to participate.

Commissioner Fountain moved than an expenditure of not to exceed $3,000.00 for the
moving of the Housing Authority building to City property located at 605 North "A"

Street and construction of a slab be authorized, provided:

1.	The Clark County Board of Commissioners authorizes an expenditure
of an equal amount.

2.	A lease first be executed between the City of Las Vegas and the
Salvation Army for the City property located at 605 North "A" Street;
a condition of the lease to be that the Salvation Army and the
United Fund bring the building up to code within a specified time.

plans so that the City of Las Vegas may take bids and award contracts
for the moving of the building and construction of the slab.

Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Commissioner Sharp asked if there were plans prepared for the project so the City can

USE PERMIT (U-1-59)	The Commission considered the application of the Homesite Baptist Church for a

Homesite Baptist Church                  use permit to construct an off-street parking lot facility adjacent to an existing

church at property located on the southwest corner of Mesquite and 25th Streets,

Abeyance	legally described as Lots 21, 22, 23 and 24, Block 2, Boulder Dam Homesite #4, in an

R-1 zone.

Approval was recommended by the Board of Zoning Adjustment, subject to the following
conditions:	(There was one protest by an adjacent owner.)

1.	Signing of an offsite improvement agreement and filing of a bond to cover the cost
of offsite improvements recommended by the Engineering Department: to-wit, alley
paving from the existing pavement on 25th Street to the west right-of-way line.

2.	Dedication of 20' along the east side of the property on 25th Street as required
by the Master Plan of Streets and Highways.

3.	Conformance to the plot plan.

4.	That the parking lot be surfaced with gravel or asphaltic concrete.

The applicants do not agree to signing the improvement agreement, posting of the bond
or dedication of 20' on 25th Street. They had expressed the desire to discuss this
with the Mayor and Board of City Commissioners.

Planning Director Bills stated that there is a serious parking problem during church
services and explained further that the church was erected before the requirements were
set for offsite parking. He said that the improvement agreement asked for the 
improvement of the alley and the surfacing of the parking lot with asphalt concrete and 
required the posting of a bond in the amount of $226.38; however, since then there has
been some agreement with the Engineering Department not to insist on the bond.

Director of Public Works Sauer stated that the foregoing is correct, but he also
understood that the church people do not desire to surface the parking lot at this
time and that under ordinance parking lots are required to be surfaced. He added
that if the Board saw fit to waive this requirement then it would not be necessary to
surface the alley either.

The Reverend Joseph Melnikoff spoke from the floor stating that he talked with Mr.

Uehling, Principal Civil Engineer, and he assured him they would maintain their portion
of the alley where the cars come in and out and that they are having a contractor come
in and fill this lot in and roll it. He (Mr. Uehling) stated that an oral agreement
would be satisfactory to them.

Mr. Sauer stated that there might have been a slight misunderstanding. He added that
if the parking lot is paved, then the alley would have to be paved as it would be used
as an exit and entrance to the parking lot. Commissioner Sharp asked about the 
dedication of the 20' along the east side of the property on 25th Street. Rev. Melnikoff
replied that they had brought their plot plans into Mr. Bills in the Planning Department
and that it would hinder their building program if this land were taken away from them.

He went on to explain that their land is owned by the Nevada-Sierra Baptist Convention
and they would have to meet on this to see if they would sign away this land or give
them the authority to do so.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple stated that it would be better to consider this now as 25th
Street will be a busy thoroughfare. The Reverend asked what they would received if
they did deed the 20' to the City for Street purposes and the Mayor Pro Tem replied
that they would receive nothing but that they would benefit by the widening of the
street improvements.

Mr. Sauer asked if the plot plan had been turned into the Building Department and
the Reverend stated that it had been turned into Mr. Saylor at the Planning Commission
Meeting and that they plan to use a gravel surface for the parking lot and would put
down an asphalt surface later on. He stated that he thought they would be granted
a temporary parking lot permit.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple suggested this matter be held in abeyance and that Reverend
Melnikoff bring some of the church trustees to meet with the board in the Mayor's Office
at 7:00 P.M. on March 11, 1959.

Commissioner Sharp moved that this application for a use permit to construct an 
off-street parking lot facility adjacent to an existing church as property located on the
southwest corner of Mesquite and 25th Streets, be held in abeyance and requested
Reverend Melnikoff bring some of the church trustees to meet with the Board in the
Mayor's Office at 7:00 P.M. on March 11, 1959.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Sharp, Fountain and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes, none.

Absent:	Mayor C. D. Baker.

USE PERMIT (U-2-59)	The Commission considered the application of W. H. Higgenbotham for	a use permit	to

International Church	allow the International Church of the Four-Square Gospel to conduct	a commercial

of 4-Square Gospel	nursery on property located at 318 South 11th Street, between Lewis	and Bridger,

legally described as Lots 23, 24, 25 and 26, Block 11, Pioneer Heights, in an R-4 zone.

Application Withdrawn

Denial was recommended by the Board of Zoning Adjustment. There were two letters of
protest; four protests in person; and a petition of owners and tenants in protest.

Planning Director Bills explained further that there was an over-whelming neighborhood
protest consisting of some 71 names and representing possibly 35 homes as some of the
names were husbands and wives.

Reverend Higgenbotham spoke from the floor stating that in view of the many protests
against their request that before they withdrew their application, he would like to
point out to the City Commission that the Four-Square Church was located there many
years before the apartment houses were built and they felt two or three had legitimate
reason to protest; however, they felt the owners who built next to the church should
have expected the church to grow. He stated that they would like to withdraw their
application for a nursery for 24 children and reduce it to 9.

3-4-59
USE PERMIT (U-3-59)	The Commission considered the application of Jessie and Edith Morgan for a use

Faith Temple	permit to conduct church services in Faith Temple, Church of God in Christ, on

property located at 905 Adams Avenue, between Cunningham and "I" Streets, legally
(Continued later in	described as a portion of the SW¼, SE¼, SE¼, NE¼, Section 28 T20S, R61E, in an

these minutes)	R-1 zone.

Denial was recommended by the Board of Zoning Adjustment. The building was constructed
for residential use; however, it is being used as a church. The Building Department
advises that the building does not meet the Building Code, the Fire Department declares
it is a fire hazard. The Engineering Department recommends connection to the City
Sewer and to the water distribution system. The Board of Zoning Adjustment advises
the applicants that if they could submit substantial proof that they could meet all
of the requirements, they would then reconsider this application. There were three
protests.

Planning Director Bills stated that the recommendation of the Zoning Board is based
completely on reports of the various City Departments and Agencies as heretofore set
forth. He further stated that they had not been able to get any kind of a plot plan.

Reverend Morgan spoke from the audience stating that they were connected with the City
Sewer and that they are paying sewer rental and also that they have water. He said
that they have submitted a sketch of the building plan showing what they request to do.

Mr. Bills stated that in the resolution adopted by the Zoning Board that he felt it
makes a very true presentation of their position. They go on record stating that
they will give serious reconsideration at such time as it is shown that this property
can come somewhere near to meeting the Codes.

At this time Mayor Pro Tem Whipple stated that is was time for the scheduled bid
opening and public hearing and continued this application for use permit until later

PUBLIC HEARING	Mayor Pro Tem Whipple asked if there was anyone present who wished to protest this

Assessment District	assessment district.

100-43; Street Lighting,

Main Street-Bonanza to	Director	of Public Works Sauer stated	that there were 18% against, 53% in favor	and 28%

Owens	from which no replies were received.	He further stated that the	estimated cost	is

$3.00 per front foot and there are 8,924 lineal feet involved.

City Attorney instructed

to prepare ordinance	Mr. Carl	A. Huffey, 1500 South 7th, a	property owner along North	Main Street asked	how

creating district	this was	rated. Mr. Robert Ruffin of	the Engineering Department	explained that	is	is

based on the percentage of front footage involved and it does not depend on the number
of people or number of parcels involved. Mr. Huffey went on to say that he was against
the assessment district on the basis that the price of it is too high. He asked if the
City had a list of the signers of the petition for the street lighting and Mr. Sauer
informed him that the City does have this list, and that notices were sent out to property
owners and that an informal public hearing was held January 19, 1959, at which time this
estimated cost was given out.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple informed Mr. Huffey that this hearing was the formal public hearing
on the assessment district. Commissioner Sharp asked if there was anyone present in
favor of the assessment district and a Mr. Reed Wittwer and Mr. Lee Speirs stood and
stated that they were in favor of it. Mr. Wittwer said that he was at the informal
hearing on January 19, 1959; and that the estimated cost was given at that time. His
opinion was that most all of the property owners were in favor except a very few. Mr.
Sauer stated that the lessees were stricken off the list and there are still 71% in
favor and that 53% have written in signifying their desire for the assessment district.

Mr. Ruffin stated that the 71% represents the front footage and the 53% the property
owners.

Commissioner Fountain moved that the City Attorney be instructed to prepare the
Emergency Ordinance creating the district and directing the preparation of the Assessment
Roll and setting the date of the public hearing on the assessments.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Fountain, Sharp and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes, none.

Absent:	Mayor C. D. Baker.

USE PERMIT (U-3-59)	The Commission again considered the application of	Jessie	and Edith	Morgan for	a use

Faith Temple	permit to conduct church services in Faith Temple,	Church	of God in	Christ, on	property

located at 905 Adams Avenue.

Denied

Joseph Cleary spoke from the audience stating that it would take time to bring this
(Continued from earlier                  building up to the requirements of the City and asked for	a chance to do this,	and that

in these minutes)	if there were more churches this would be a better	world.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple informed him that no one opposes the right to worship but reminded
him that the City does have a building code to be met. Mrs. Edith Morgan spoke from
the floor stating that first they applied for a permit to hold their services in a tent

3-4-59
and then the City asked them to get a meeting place, which they have done. She
further stated that they had improved this building and did not understand why
they call it a fire hazard and asked just what the City wanted them to do.

Commissioner Bunker said that it appeared to him that this building does not even
meet the minimum requirements and further that the City has competent people who
inspect these buildings and they report in written letter that this is a fire
hazard. Mayor Pro Tem Whipple stated that as he saw it, the Commission could not
approve this use permit, and suggested that the applicants check this out with the
Building Department to see just what should be done.

Commissioner Bunker moved that the application of Jessie and Edith Morgan for a
use permit to conduct church services in Faith Temple, Church of God in Christ, on
property located at 905 Adams Avenue, be denied on the basis that the Commission
cannot encourage these people to continue on with this building unless they can
bring the building up to code.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Fountain, Sharp and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes, none.

Absent:	Mayor C. D. Baker.

USE PERMIT (U-4-59)	The Commission considered the application of Shirley Day for a use permit to conduct

Shirley Day	a mimeographing service as a customary home occupation, for a period not to exceed

six months, on property located at 820 Clarkway Drive, between Washington and Bonanza,
Approved	legally described as a portion of the E½, NE¼, NW¼, SW¼, Section 28, T20S, R61E,

M.D.B.&M., in an R-E zone.

The Board of Zoning Adjustment recommended that the request for a use permit to
conduct a mimeographing service as a home occupation be denied, but that a temporary
(Non-renewable) permit for a period not to exceed six months be granted, subject to
the condition that there be no signs displayed. The Board of Zoning Adjustment did
not want to qualify A mimeographing service as being a customary home occupation.

Commissioner Bunker moved that the application of Shirley Day for a use permit be
approved as a temporary (non-renewable) permit for a period not to exceed six months
be approved subject to the condition that there be no signs displayed.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Bunker, Fountain, Sharp and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes, none.

Absent:	Mayor C. D. Baker.

VARIANCE (V-4-59)	The Commission considered the application of Sam P. Cava for a Variance to waive

Sam P. Cava	front yard setback requirements on South 8th Street thereby permitting the construction

of a building up to the front property line, on property located at 721 E. Charleston
Denied	Boulevard, between Charleston and Gass, on South 8th, legally described as Lots 22,

23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29, Block 34, South Addition, and a portion of Block B,

Wardie Addition, in an R-4 zone.

Denial was recommended by the Board of Zoning Adjustment and there were four letters
of protest. Planning Director Bills stated that denial has been recommended primarily
because for some three years now there have been a variety of variances and use permits
in R-4 zones, and in each case these offices along Charleston Boulevard have been held
to the same setbacks as an apartment building. He contended that if this variance
was approved there would be more applications for the same type of variances on the
basis that this had been allowed for other applicants.

Julius Gabriele, Architect, spoke on behalf of the applicant stating that the property
line is 15' back from the curb on South 8th and with the 10' setback would make a 25'
setback and they feel that this is excessive, and they are of the opinion that there
would still be plenty of room for landscaping if the front yard setback was waived.

Commissioner Sharp requested to see the plot plan for this development and Mr. Bills
presented them to the Commission. Mr. Bills again stated that if this setback requirement 
was waived for the applicant that there would be more and more requests
for variances in connection with setback requirements and reminded the Commission
that there were four letters of protest received.

Commissioner Fountain moved that the application of Sam P. Cava for a variance to
waive front yard setback requirements on South 8th Street on property located at 721
East Charleston Boulevard, be denied as recommended by the Board of Zoning Adjustment.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Fountain, Sharp and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes, none.

Absent:	Mayor C. D. Baker.

Withdrawn by Applicant

protest and seven verbal protests recorded at the Board of Zoning Adjustment meeting.

This application was not considered by the Commission as it was withdrawn by the
applicant prior to the time the meeting convened.

BUDGET HEARING	This being the time heretofore set for the hearing on the proposed budget for the fiscal

Proposed Budget	year 1959-60; City Manager Kennedy presented the proposed budget to the Mayor and Board

for Fiscal Year	of City Commissioners and discussed the major factors to be called to the attention of

1959 - 60	the Board prior to the adoption of the proposed budget.

Adopted	Mr. Kennedy pointed out that the total estimated expenditures in tie proposed budget is

$4,372,025.48 excluding bonded debt expenditures and that the total proposed budget 
including bonded debt expenditures is $5,148,316.52. He pointed out that the proposed
budget for the fiscal year 1955.60 for the City of Las Vegas is based on $1.58 tax rate.

He then discussed the major changes in the departmental budgets pointing out the proposed
increase of thirteen personnel in the Police Department, six personnel in the Fire Department 
and the corresponding increase in operating expenses in these departments as a result
of the additional personnel.

Mr. Kennedy then pointed out that there was a proposed capital outlay expenditure in
Civil Defense of $35,000 which is primarily for the purchase of equipment through the
Federal Civil Defense Program wherein we will be able to acquire equipment at a fraction
of the normal cost.

He then discussed the proposed program in the Street, Park and Recreation Departments
including the fact that there are funds budgeted for participation in a Community
Facilities Loan from the Federal Government in the amount of $750,000 if made available
to be used for development of the City Park facilities. If the money is made available
it would be payable on a 10-year basis at an interest rate of approximately 3%.

Mr. Kennedy stated that there are personnel provided in the proposed budget to place
summer time recreation leaders in seven areas in the City. Mayor Baker pointed out that
the same provision was made in this yearns budget; however, the demand on the part of
the public was such that not all of the positions were filled and that the positions would
be filled on the basis of need and demand as reflected in the wishes of the general public.

Commissioner Bunker asked Mr. Kennedy if there were funds provided in the proposed
budget for the development of the Hyde Park recreation area. Mr. Kennedy replied that it
is planned that this area will be, if possible, completed between now and the end of this
fiscal year. He also pointed out in reply to a question of Commissioner Bunker that work
would progress as rapidly as possible on the Lions Club Park baseball diamond and that
they should definitely have it available for use of the children this summer.

Discussion was also held regarding the bonded indebtedness and assessed valuation wherein
it was pointed out that the outstanding bonded indebtedness as of July 1, 1959 would be
$3,682,000 and the assessed valuation would be $128,501,369 representing a ratio of
bonded debt to assessed Valuation of approximately 3% which is a very favorable ratio and
considerably less than that of most cities.

3-4-59 & 3-11-59
Mayor Baker asked if there was anyone present who cared to ask any questions regarding
the proposed budget or make any comments regarding the proposed budget. There being no
questions or comments from the audience, Mayor Baker concluded the hearing by stating
that, in summary, the increase in the proposed budget is roughly ten to twelve percent
over the budget of the current year and the proposed tax rate represents an increase from
$1.46 to $1.58 which in his opinion and that of the Board was a reasonable increase 
commensurate with the population growth of the City and the necessarily increased demands
upon the services to be provided by the City.

Commissioner Fountain moved that the following budget for the City of Las Vegas for the
fiscal year 1959-60 be adopted:

REZONING (Z-2-59)	The Commission considered the application of R. J. Kaltenbom for reclassification of

R. J. Kaltenbom	property generally located at the southwest corner of Rancho and Bonanza, legally 

described as a portion of the SW¼, SE¼, Section 29, R61E, T20S, from R-1 to C-2.

Approved

Planning Commission recommends the application be amended to be a change from R-1 to
C-1 and that it be approved subject to the stipulation that a concrete block fence
be erected along the west line of the property and that a service road be put in along
the east line of the property. Mr. Paul Ferguson, owner of the Twin Lakes Village
Shopping Center, appeared at the Planning Commission Meeting in protest; Mr. Bob
Campbell, owner of a filling station in the vicinity, also protested.

Planning Director Bills pointed out the property in question on the map, stating that
it is just south of the extension of Bonanza Road and that although it is presently
designated R-1, it is pretty much committed to commercial use. He further stated that
the reason for the concrete block fence was to separate it from the sub-division.

His Honor Mayor Baker asked if there were any objections from anyone present. 
Commissioner Sharp asked if there was an accessible alley anywhere around this property
and Mr. Bills replied that there was not. Commissioner Sharp asked if an alley was not
normally required. Mr. Bills stated that there could be an alley inside the block wall
if the Commission felt that this was necessary. His Honor Mayor Baker suggested this
be brought to the attention of the Building Department.

At this time Mr. Paul Ferguson, one of the objectors to this rezoning, spoke from the
floor stating that it was his opinion that more serious consideration should be given
to this proposal than has been given up to this point. He stated that there are 35
acres commercial in the area now with approximately 5 acres developed which was more
than adequate for neighborhood shopping center. He referred to Mr. Bills statement
before the Planning Commission that if this 5 acres were zoned commercial that 
approximately 18 more acres would be committed to be zoned commercial, and this would mean
that property to the north would also become commercial. He stated there were already
6 service stations in the area and that only two were now in financially good condition.

He presented the Board with a petition which had been signed by approximately 150
residents in the area of Rancho Park and Rancho Circle, objecting and protesting to
the reclassification of this property from R-1 to C-1. He appealed to the Commission
in the name of good zoning, good economy and good planning for the future of this City
to deny this rezoning application. He also pointed out that there was only a two to
one vote on this by the Planning Commission.

Commissioner Sharp asked that in order to build a filling station in C-1, if it was not
necessary for the owner to get a use permit and Mr. Bills stated that it was. 
Commissioner Sharp further stated that at the Planning Commission Meeting, Mr. Kaltenbom
said this would be divided into three parcels:	one for a church, one for a nursery

which has been forced to move because of the freeway and on the other he hoped to get
a filling station. Mr. Bills stated that this was correct.

Commissioner Whipple moved that the application of R. J. Kaltenbom for reclassification
of property generally located at the southwest corner of Rancho and Bonanza, legally
described as a portion of the SW¼, SE¼, Section 29, R61E, T20S, from R-1 to C-1 as
recommended by the Planning Commission be approved, subject to the stipulation that a
concrete block fence be erected along the west line of the property and that a service
road be put in along the east line of the property; and that the City Attorney be in-
structed to prepare the necessary ordinance.

Fountain.

Approved	from R-E to R-2-T. Two protests were received from adjoining property owners. Approval

recommended by the Planning Commission.

Director of Planning Bills stated that R-2-T is for Trailer Park Zoning, but in order
for anyone to have a trailer park, it would still be necessary to get a use permit for
this purpose.

Commissioner Bunker moved that the application of E. L. Noble for the reclassification
of property generally located on the southwest corner of Lamb Blvd. (Noble Lane) and
East Bonanza Road, legally described as a portion of the NE¼, NE¼, Section 31, R62E,

T20S from R-E to R-2-T be approved and the City Attorney be instructed to prepare the

as Irregular Block 32, South Addition from R-4 to C-2. Denial recommended by the Planning
Denied	Commission. There were eight protests. Planning Director Bills explained that a root

beer drive-in is being contemplated to be put in at this location.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the application of Doss-Wright for the reclassification of
property generally located on Charleston between 6th and 7th Streets, legally described
as Irregular Block 32, South Addition, from R-4 to C-2 be denied as recommended by the
Planning Commission.

At this point Mayor Baker asked Mr. Bills that in regard to Rezoning (Z-2-59) and
Rezoning (Z-4-59) that when application is made for whatever particular use is 
intended, a use permit would still be required, and Mr. Bills answered in the 
affirmative stating that approval of said use permits will also come before the Board
of City Commissioners.

in the elimination of one of the two proposed curb cuts along Bonanza and a relocation
of one of the two proposed curb cuts on Rancho, and a slight realignment of the curb
radius.

The improvement agreements have not been drawn up yet because the improvements will
depend upon the particular design, and until the design is approved, the improvements
cannot be estimated. There were three protestants present at the meeting, all of them
involved in the operation of filling stations, and their protests were to the effect
that there were already too many filling stations in this area.

have every confidence in the Child Welfare Board and its recommendations regarding the
operations and regulations of child nurseries in the City of Las Vegas.

At this time Mr. Christensen introduced Mrs. Connie Mormon to speak in her own behalf. She
stated that she did have a child with a case of chicken pox in her nursery at 827 South 7th
whom she isolated in an isolation room with bathroom that passed qualifications of the Board
of Health. She stated this child had been living with her for two years this July and when
she took ill she put her to bed in the isolation room and that no one went into that room
other than herself, her housekeeper and her own daughter who had already had chicken pox.

She stated that in her experience with this disease and according to information from doctors
that she was led to believe that two days before a child breaks out the disease can be 
communicated and after that is contagious upon touch. She stated further that she did not know
she was violating a law by keeping this child and that had she known that she was putting
herself in jeopardy she would have committed the child to a hospital. She added further
that she was guilty of having this child in this isolation room, but that Dr. D. D. Carr,
Health Officer, Clark County Health Department, had informed her that he could see nothing
wrong with this arrangement.

Mrs. Mormon went on to say that she did the best to her knowledge in the last six years
experience of caring for children in this City.

His Honor Mayor Baker stated that the crux of this situation is the reaction of child nursery
operators to the laws and regulations as set up by the Child Welfare Board and cooperation
with this agency that has been set up to govern operation of child welfare nurseries. He
stated that it appeared that Mrs. Mormon had apparently flaunted these recommendations. He
added that if Mrs. Mormon had these statements from doctors, that would be a point, but as
far as the Commission is concerned they were concerned with the reports from the Child
Welfare Board and their periodical examinations of child care nurseries and cooperation is
expected from the operators and if there was any misunderstanding it goes to this Board who
devote time and effort to maintaining the nurseries in accordance with City Ordinance and
this Board recommends to the City Commission corrective measures to see that minor children
are properly cared for. His Honor continued that they should confine themselves as to
whether or not Mrs. Mormon was, or was not, going to cooperate with the agencies of the City.

Mrs. Mormon stated that nothing was said as to what to do with the 24 hour child under the
circumstances involved.

Commissioner Fountain asked Mrs. Mormon if she did not realize that as an operator of this
type of home she would have to come to the Chid Welfare Board and go over rules of the City.

He further stated that he believed she had a persecution complex and that when the Child
Welfare Officer or members of the Child Welfare Board called on her she fought with them
and called them names.

Mrs. Mormon denied that she did this.

Commissioner Whipple verified the fact that the child in question who had chicken pox was
Debbie Quam and asked if Mrs. Mormon contacted Dr. Ryan at the time the child was taken ill
or if she had called any doctor in this regard.

Mrs. Mormon stated that she did not contact Dr. Ryan and did not say that she had nor had
she called any doctor, but that she knew what to do and she put the child to bed and
isolated her and put calamine lotion on the rash.

Commissioner Whipple stated that this was not the point as Mrs. Mormon did know the child
had a contagious disease and was in the same building where other children were being cared
for and asked her what she did to protect the other children.

Mrs. Mormon answered that she put the child in the isolation room and that her daughter was
allowed in this room as she had already had the chicken pox.

Commissioner Whipple asked Mrs. Mormon what her attitude was when called upon by the Child
Welfare Officer or members of the Child Welfare Board and expressed the Commission's concern 
of the operation under these licenses in the City of Las Vegas.

Mrs. Mormon stated that her feeling toward the Board was to work together with them. She
stated that there was no law to quarantine the whole establishment and if she broke a rule
it was because this child makes her home with her.

Commissioner Whipple referred to Item (2) in the letter of April 3, 1959, citing Mrs. Mormon
to appear which stated that Mrs. Mormon failed to obey instructions to take no additional
children after service of notice to  take no furthe-children for a period of two weeks and
asked if she did take any children in after she received this letter and Mrs. Mormon answered
that she did not. She stated that she registered two children while the Child Welfare Officer
was waiting to serve this notice. In answer to Commissioner Sharp's question she stated that
she had not as yet read the notice. She said she read and signed the notice after she had
registered these two children.



Commissioner Whipple asked Mrs. Mormon if she took children under two years of age and she 
replied that she did not to her knowledge. Commissioner Fountain asked if she would not know

if a child was under two and Mrs. Mormon stated she asked the mother the age of the child
and would register the child if the age was over two.

4-15-49
Commissioner Sharp asked Mrs. Mormon if, when this notice was served she threatened the
Child Welfare Officer, Mrs. Schnaer, and she replied that she did not.

At this point Mayor Baker asked Mrs. Mormon if she had any other statement to make and she
replied only that what she had said was the truth and that she operated her establishment to
the best of her ability. Then His Honor asked the Chairman of the Child Welfare Board to
make a statement.

Jack Pursel; Chairman of the Child Welfare Board, stated that he would like to defer to
Mrs. Schnaer; Child Welfare Officer, on this matter and, when asked, replied that he was
informed in this case as various reports had been brought to the attention of their Board.

Mayor Baker asked him as Chairman of the Child Welfare Board as to whether or not in 
investigating child welfare nurseries there had been any conflict or objections to compliance with
City Ordinance governing child welfare nurseries and if this was a case where there had been
a lack of compliance with the ordinance or the administration of his board as indicted or a
lack of appreciation of what this board is trying to do in providing working parents with
competent nurseries to care for their children while they are working.

Mr. Pursel replied that there have been other instances of violations from time to time in
nurseries in this community but that in general they are rare and cooperation on the part of
the operator when a violation is noted and suggestion is made has been to comply fully. He
added that in this particular case, on the basis of evidence brought before the Board, it
appears certain violations have been made as outlined in report before the Board of City
Commissioners. He concluded that that was about all he could say about the situation other
than notice was served on Mrs. Mormon to prevent further spread of a contagious disease and
also this show cause hearing was being held so that these matters might be straightened out.

Mayor Baker asked that as far as Mr. Pursel knew and from the Child Welfare Board's observance
that there had been nafcase in which operators involved have refused to go along with in-
structions and in most cases did not fail to comply with the suggestions of the Board.

Mr. Pursel replied that the Board's interest is to protect the children and see that City
Ordinance and regulations are complied with. The Mayor asked if the same regulations apply
to all nurseries and Mr. Pursel replied they are equal as far as they are able to make it.

Jeane Boman, member of the Child Welfare Board spoke stating that she was present with Mrs.
Terrell Evans, another Board member and the Child Welfare Officer on March 30, 1959 at the
Las Vegas Children's Nursery when it was suggested that the child with the chicken pox be
removed from the nursery as she was in a stage of contagion, and that Mrs. Mormon said she
had been informed by Dr. Ryan that the child was not in a stage of contagion. Also that they
had observed a child under the age of 2 years, that there were cases of no records or 
incomplete records, and that Debbie Quam was being taken back and forth from Happy House. She
added that they do feel that Mrs. Mormon had been uncooperative with their Board.

Commissioner Whipple repeated this information that three of our representatives had gone to
the nursery and asked Mrs. Mormon about this child and that she stated that she had contacted
Dr. Ryan and he informed her once the scabs appeared the chicken pox was no longer contagious.

At this time Mrs. Terrell Evans, member of the Child Welfare Board, spoke substantiating Mrs.
Boman's statement. Diane Schnaer, Child Welfare Officer also confirmed that these were the
statements made by Mrs. Mormon.

Mrs. Mormon spoke stating that this was a misunderstanding of what she had said and that her
statement was that her doctor had told her that the contagious stage is two days before the
child breaks out and after that she had said Br. Ryan was the child's doctor. She stated
that she had contacted no doctor in this particular case.

Mrs. Glenn Anderson presented her child from the audience and asked if this was the child
in question who was supposedly under 2 years of age. Hettie Winterman stated from the audience
that she has a 9 year old son that goes to Mrs. Mormon's nursery school and that he is very
small for his age and that these ladies had stated that he was under two years of age.

Mrs. Audry Strange spoke informing the Board that she was Connie Mormon's housekeeper and had
been employed by her since the second week in January and that she was on duty when Diane
Schnaer and the doctor she had with her (Dr. George, member of the Child Welfare Board) visited
the nursery in regard to their statement that this child was being transported back and forth
and she could transport the germs, she said that the child had not been out of the isolation
room and that Diane knew she had made this statement.

Mrs. Evans pointed out that when they made their visit to Happy House the girl on duty told
them that Vicky and Debbie were being brought there every night.

His Honor Mayor Baker stated that it is the inclination of the Commission to give primary
consideration to the recommendation of the Child Welfare Board and the Child Welfare Officer
whom this Commission has appointed. He stated that the prime purpose of these people is to
provide proper nursery schools for working parents add any discrimination or arbitrary tactics
by any operator is a serious matter and if Mrs. Mormon had not violated the rules or had not
been uncooperative with the Child Welfare Board that she would not be appearing at this show
cause hearing. He stated that he thought it was a matter of Mrs. Mormon getting along with
all governing agencies, and that if she felt that she was being persecuted and not being
treated the same as anyone else, that is what the remarks should be confined to.

Commissioner Fountain asked Mrs. Mormon if she did feel that she was being persecuted and
she answered that she did not. Commissioner Fountain stated that the statement from the
three ladies of the Child Welfare conflict with Mrs. Mormon's statement regarding the 
transporting of these children.

Mrs. Mormon stated that they were being transported back and forth to Happy House but that
no children were being kept there other than Debbie and Vicky, and that they were being
transported back and forth prior to the time they were ill.

Commissioner Fountain stated that in view of Mrs. Mormon's attitude toward the Child Welfare
Board he wondered what her attitude might be toward the children she takes care of in her
nurseries. Mrs. Mormon replied that her children could speak for themselves when they gave
her their good-morning and good-night kisses.

4-15-59
Jim Watkins spoke from the audience stating that his two boys attend Mrs. Mormon's
nursery and he thought the point of this whole hearing was being missed and that the
question was what should she have done with this child when she did break out with
chicken pox.

Commissioner Whipple asked him if he thought she did the right thing and if he would
want his children exposed. Mr. Watkins replied that he would not want his children
exposed but that she did isolate the child and that personally he thought there was a
little bit of prejudice being shown.

Ramona Quam, mother of the child Debbie, spoke stating that she knew her child was not
being transported while she was sick with the chicken pox and that Mrs. Mormon had taken
  care of Debbie for two years and there would have been no other way for her to do other
than to have put the child in the hospital. Mrs. Quam further stated that Debbie goes
to Connie like she would to her own mother so she knew what kind of care she was getting.
Commissioner Whipple asked her who was her doctor and she replied that he was Dr. Ryan.

In reply to another question from Commissioner Whipple she stated that Debbie was at
the nursery in the isolation room when she had chicken pox.

Sid Sheppard spoke stating that the reason he was interested was because he was in
Variety and Variety Day School Nursery and that he felt there was a little prejudice
in this case. He stated that he knows Mrs. Mormon has a sharp tongue. He further
stated that in view of the rules and regulations set up by ordinance, every nursery
should be called upon the carpet.

He stated he had checked the nurseries and the feeling of the Child Welfare Board and
Mrs. Mormon has the feeling she is being picked on. He said he knew she had made a
mistake and that every nursery in town had made a mistake. He stated that he had offered
his services to the Child Welfare Board and he thought there was room for improvement and
that he would like to help and he believed that personalities are being entered into.

His Honor Mayor Baker stated that he has every confidence in the Child Welfare Board that
has been appointed and that he did not believe they have any bad feeling toward Connie
Mormon. He said maybe the ordinance should be changed but as for the flaunting of what
this board is trying to do, he thought it incumbent on the people to try and change the
thing rather than fight it.

Mr. Sheppard again asserted that he thought personalities entered into it and His Honor
stated that he would like to know what it was. Mr. Sheppard stated that he was for the
Child Welfare Board and that he believed that with the personality that had entered into
it, there had been a petition put out by one of the Board. He further stated that he
thought Mrs. Mormon should be given all the consideration. With regard to the rules and
regulations he thought a copy of all of the standards should be sent to every nursery so
they could know how to operate. He stated Mrs. Mormon is standing alone and feels she
is being picked on and if this could be cleared up everything would be fine.

Mrs. Jean Ayoub spoke stating that she would like to address her remarks to Commissioner
Fountain. She stated that her boy has a malformation of the brain and that she had been
told he would never walk or talk and that she wouldn't dream of taking him out of Mrs.
Mormon's nursery. She stated that Mrs. Mormon doesn't give him any particular attention
and that she entered him in the nursery for discipline because she had spoiled him during
his illness. At first she was skeptical because her little boy was so badly spoiled. She
further stated that her son had made wonderful progress under Mrs. Mormon's care, and that
Mrs. Mormon refused extra compensation and that child care was her code and child care was
what she gave. She said that there is no such thing as two women not being able to rub
each other the wrong way, and that she hoped the Child Welfare Board would work something
out for these children who are happy in these nurseries.

Commissioner Fountain referred to Sid Sheppard's remarks and stated that he felt that Mrs.
Mormon had a complex and felt that she was being persecuted and it was a question of
working the thing out.

Mr. Sheppard asked why it was that five nurseries have fear of the Child Welfare Board and
that their operators would speak if they were called upon. He again stated that he would
like to get on the Child Welfare Board himself to do some good.

Jack Pursel spoke again stating that he has no prejudice against Mrs. Mormon and that he
had been in her nurseries on several occasions and that the physical set-ups are the
finest. He said that the objective of this Board is to foster nurseries, not to close
their doors and that cooperation of the operators is necessary. He stated that no one
on this Board received any personal enrichment, they simply devoted this time as a 
community service and everyone faithfully attempted to do a good job. He stated that mistakes
may be made but that any office might make mistakes based on no faults or prejudice which
if they existed he had not seen them. He stated that it was somewhat painful to have members
of this Board called liars and that is about what some of these statements have amounted to.
He felt that they had gotten off the track on the subject of transporting this child back
and forth and that there was another child in and out of the room who was in contact with
other children. His interest was the same as the parents who were present and that was to
protect children from being subjected to disease and new children being admitted. He
further stated that he did not know of any prejudice whatsoever and did not know why any
nurseries have fear of the Child Welfare Board and they are always willing to have anyone
come to their meetings and discuss their problems with them and see that nursery facilities
are provided and children protected.

Mr. Christensen stated he believed that Mrs. Mormon had been cited for certain infractions
of the operation of her nurseries and that she had refused to cooperate and was antagonistic
with the Child Welfare people. He further stated that she had broken a few rules here;
however, he believed this did not truthfully portray an undercurrent that existed and that
it was no secret from the Child Welfare Board and that on occasions Connie Mormon had been
critical of the Child Welfare Officer appointed by the Commission. Further that her attitude
was a personal one trying to correct something in a case where she thought she was wronged.
Other nurseries had been opened that were not required to come up to the standards as set
forth. He stated that she probably had made some mistakes as her personality is not the
easiest to get along with. He was of the belief that this fine child nursery facility
should not be closed. He stated he was sure that Mrs. Mormon had learned in the past two
weeks since she was cited to appear that she had talked too much, too hard, saying the wrong
things to the wrong people. He stated that the action should probably be to reprimand Mrs.
Mormon and inform her that she will have to cooperate with the Child Welfare Board and not

4-15-49
to revoke her license on this first infraction she has been cited for; thereby creating no
adverse effect on the parents that depend on her to care for their children.

Commissioner Sharp asked Mrs. Mormon a direct question regarding threats and name calling by
her as set out in a sworn statement by the Child Welfare Officer and Mrs. Mormon declared that
she did not make these threats or call these names.

Msgr. Carmody, Child Welfare Board member, spoke to the Board stating that he was the last
surviving member of the original Board and that he had had contact with Mrs. Mormon on
occasions over the years, found her in violations of one degree or another, and upon going
back later found that these things had not been rectified. He stated that one experience over
at her nursery was when he made some suggestions to her and was promptly chewed out in such
a manner that he told her not to shout at him and that he was a gentleman and not to be shouted
at. He asked her questions and she immediately became very defensive as if it was none of his
business.

Msgr. Carmody continued that on another morning Mrs. Mormon punished a child to a degree that
he could not approve of when in a fit of temper she shook him severely and marched him to a
corner.

Commissioner Whipple stated that he thought a lot had been said and a lot of things which were
doubtful, and the matter goes back to 1954 when Mrs. Mormon was cited by the City Clerk and he
did not believe that Mrs. Mormon was quite frank when she stated that she had no animosity
toward the Child Welfare Board. He stated further that he was one of the Commissioners who
had appointed these people to the Child Welfare Board and he felt that she owed them a debt of
gratitude.

Speaking to Sid Sheppard, Commissioner Whipple referred to his statement concerning other
nurseries and said that was news to him but that he didn't think it necessary to get into
that at this time and that the discussion at hand should not be prolonged. He stated that
if he could feel in his own mind that Connie Mormon would work in harmony with this Board, he
would even make the motion that she be put on probation and if she could prove herself that would
be fine. He said it was a very serious business caring for young children in their tender
years and he thought child nurseries consisted of more than dollars and cents and there was
much to be considered. He again mentioned that this was not a new situation and not the first
time Mrs. Mormon had been brought to the Attention of the City.

Commissioner Sharp stated that he wished to concur in the praise of the Child Welfare Board
and the citizens should be thankful for people of the calibre of those who are serving on
this Board.

Commissioner Whipple moved that Mrs. Connie Mormon be permitted to operate on a probationary
basis at the Las Vegas Children's Nursery, 827 South 7th and Happy House, 516 North 9th until
the next meeting of the Board of City Commissioners to be held May 6, 1959, at which time a
report shall be submitted by the Child Welfare Board regarding compliance and cooperation of
Mrs. Mormon with the Child Welfare Rules and Regulations and the Child Welfare Board.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

ALTA VISTA #4	Director of Public Works advised the Board that plans for Alta Vista #4 have been submitted

Acceptance of	and approved with the exception of the street lighting plans. The subdivider, Royes Petersen,

Final Plat	has requested that the street lighting be omitted from this subdivision until participation

can be obtained from property owners on the south side of St. Louis.

Approved

Mr. Sauer further advised that it is the recommendation of the Engineering Department that
this subdivision not be approved without proper street lighting as required by Subdivision
Ordinance No. 628. No bond has as yet been submitted pending a decision on the street lighting
nor has the subdivision agreement been signed.

The subdivider has requested that the Offsite improvements on Southridge #6 and Alta Vista #4
be included under one bond and this be a certified check for the offsite improvements on Alta
Vista #4 and the remaining uncompleted improvements on Southridge #6.

Mr. Sauer stated that it was originally required that street lighting be installed for the
entire section from Maryland Parkway to 6th Street, but that the School Board and the City
have installed street lighting on the south side opposite the school and City property at
no cost to Mr. Petersen.

Mention was made that City Ordinance requires every subdivider to put in street lights.

Mayor Baker and Commissioner Sharp were of the opinion that Mr. Petersen should not have to
stand this whole expense. At this time there was some discussion of making a change in
Ordinance No. 628 as Mr. Sauer stated there had been quite a few proposals to change it.

Commissioner Whipple moved that the acceptance of final plat for Alta Vista #4 be approved
subject to the condition that the subdivider, Royes Petersen sign subdivision improvement
agreement and post the necessary bond as required by the City Attorney, and further that the
subdivider pay half the cost of the street lights from 6th Street to Maryland Parkway.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

BEVERLY GREEN TRACT #4	The Commission considered the acceptance of final plat for Beverly Green Tract #4 as submitted

designs and recommended approval, of this subdivision plat subject to signing of the Subdivision
Approved	Agreement and posting of bond by the subdivider, Beverly Green Development Corporation.

City Attorney Cory advised the Board that the Subdivision Agreement has been signed but that it
would be necessary for a new bond to be submitted.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the acceptance of final plat for Beverly Green Tract #4 be approved
subject to posting of proper bond as approved by the City Attorney.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

set up a district or some similar organization that can supply information to the Corps of
Engineers. June 30th has been set as the date when the flood control study is to be gathered

the Las Vegas Board of City Commissioners, the Clark County Commissioners, City of North Las
Vegas and City of Henderson to see what could be done in this regard.

CURB PAVING MACHINE	City Manager Kennedy requested approval of Purchase Requisition No. 5406 to Clark County 

Wholesale in the amount of $1,401.25 for the purchase of an Etnyre Curb Paver. There are two locaL
suppliers and prices were obtained from both; however, one machine is too small and too
cumbersome to operate; the other is the Etnyre Curb Paver which is the same type of machine
as the State and County have and the same as we have been borrowing from the County.

They have too much use for this machine for us to continue borrowing same.

Commissioner Sharp asked if it was cheaper for the City to do this work than hire a contractor.
Director of Public Works Sauer stated that H. W. Polk has done some of these jobs but some
are so small the City cannot get bids on them. He further stated that now the contractors
are all busy and that the summer time is the time to work with this hot mix.

His Honor Mayor Baker suggested entering into a contract with some company to have them do
these small jobs as they are needed to be done. After further discussion, it was decided to
try to get bids on these small jobs before considering purchase of the machine.

PACKAGE LIQUOR	City Manager Kennedy presented two applications, one for a Package Liquor License by Joseph

APPLICATION	Julian Liquor Store and one for transfer of a Tavern License by G. Patrick Kennedy; for

Joe Julian	Patrick's Peyton Place; both to be located in the San Francisco Square Shopping Center at

&	2400 South Fifth Street.

TAVERN LICENSE RELOCATION

G. Patrick Kennedy	Mr. Kennedy explained that neither one of these applicants is ready to go into this new 

location but there has to be additional plumbing added if their applications are approved and
Abeyance	they would like to put the plumbing in now as the building is being constructed.

VeNoy Christoffersen, Attorney, spoke representing G. Patrick Kennedy explaining that this
transfer was requested due to the fact that since his tavern license was approved for 1100
Fremont another tavern is operating within a block and a half and that in the location at
2400 South Fifth there are no other tavern licenses for four and one-half blocks and 
furthermore the parking facilities will be more adequate. He further stated they feel it would be
better location, not only commercially, but a better location for the City to have a tavern
than on Fremont Street. In addition, he stated that Mr. Kennedy has leased two spaces in
this building now being erected and proposes to have this tavern in conjunction with a 
restaurant which would make the situation better for having a tavern there. This transfer is for
an existing license.

Mr. Joe Julian spoke to the Board stating that his application is for a Package Liquor License.

Mr. Patrick Kennedy spoke stating that there are 22 stores being built in this shopping center
which should be an asset to the City and that there should be a lot of patronage in that area
and plenty of parking space. He stated he had no intention of jeopardizing his position and
his reason for requesting change of location was because he believed it would be more readily
absorbed in that area than on Fremont Street.

Commissioner Sharp brought up the fact that other applicants in that area have been denied
applications and Commissioner Fountain stated that he could recall many applicants that have
been turned down in this location since he has been on the City Commission.

After some discussion it was decided to hold these two applications in abeyance.

up in these two businesses and that she would like to be able to save at least one of them.

see how Mrs. Elmore was going to control it. Commissioner Fountain added that there was too much

 CIGARETTE APPLICATION                The Commission considered the application of George Bramley et al, 2546 Charleston Blvd for
New	cigarette license for George's Chuck Wagons (4 trucks).

George's Chuck Wagon

Ray Sheffer, Chief of Police, stated that the unfavorable police report had reference to the
Denied	type of operation and that the applicants had been cleared favorably by the Police Department.

He explained further that there were four trucks vending throughout the City, mainly to
construction workers, and presented a serious police problem and one they could not control.

He added that the intention of the operators may be the same as the Police Department but that
the control of the sale of cigarettes to minors could not be controlled and denial was
recommended.

Commissioner Whipple asked how this would differ from the sale of cigarettes in grocery stores
and Chief Sheffer explained that this type of sale can be watched and that cigarette machines
are directed to be placed near the cashier, and that on a moving license this would not be
possible and could not be policed. He stated further that he felt the applicants were 
responsible but that this type of operation would put the actual control of the sale of cigarettes on
the hands of four people.

5-6-59
CIGARETTE APPLICATION           City Manager Kennedy advised the Board that this type of sale was stopped in the case of the

owners.

Resolutions (2)	School Redevelopment Project and making certain findings and determinations regarding the legal

eligibility of the project area.

Adopted

Director of Planning Bills stated that this resolution had been checked by the City Attorney
and reviewed by the Regional Office and found to be in order. City Attorney Cory advised the
Board that this resolution does not in effect establish the boundaries as such but does 
	establish the legal eligibility of the area nor does it commit the City to proceed with the project.

This resolution summarizes the findings contained in the Eligibility and Relocation Report that
has just been completed by the Urban Renewal Division of the Planning Department and is a 
requirement of the Housing and Home Finance Agency that the Board of City Commissioners pass a 
resolution determining that the project is legally eligible under Federal, State, and Local Law.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the following resolution be adopted and order made:

	RESOLUTION DESIGNATING THE AREA OF THE MADISON

SCHOOL REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AND MAKING CERTAIN
	FINDINGS AND DETERMINATIONS REGARDING THE LEGAL

ELIGIBILITY OF THE PROJECT AREA

WHEREAS, under Title I of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended and supplemented, the

WHEREAS, the remaining area all zoned for some type of residential uses, consists of
residential buildings, residential trailer parks and vacant land intermingled between the

WHEREAS, the Urban Renewal Project area is delineated in such a manner that it is
a part of a larger urban renewal area for which a renewal plan has been prepared as a result of
a Feasibility Survey performed by the Local Public Agency and completed in 1958, and is of such
a size that it may be efficiently carried out within the funds available for carrying out urban
renewal projects, and after it is redeveloped it will be surrounded on two sides by vacant land,
on the third side by a public school facility and a future urban renewal rehabilitation project
area, and on the fourth side by a future urban renewal redevelopment project area; and

WHEREAS, the location of Madison School Project "Nev. R-6" is such that the area

WHEREAS, the characteristics and conditions stated above were investigated by the
Urban Renewal Division of the Department of Planning and reported in that document known as
the Eligibility and Relocation Report for the Madison School Project dated May 6, 1959, a
copy of which report is on file in the Department of Planning, City Hall, City of Las Vegas,
for public inspection; and

WHEREAS, all or part of the above information is necessary to determine that the
area is legally eligible as an urban renewal clearance and redevelopment project under Federal,
State, and local law;

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the standards and criteria used for the 
determination of the slum and blighted conditions in the aforesaid Project Nev. No. R-6, are in 
accordance with Federal, State, and local law, and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the aforesaid Eligibility and Relocation Report as filed
in the Department of Planning, does take into consideration all of the conditions and facts
as they exist within the project area and substantiates this Resolution and the legal eligibility 
of said project; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED by the Board of City Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas,
that said Madison School Project "Nev. R-6" is eligible for clearance and redevelopment under
the provisions of Title I of the Housing Act of 1949, Chapter 279 of the Nevada Revised Statutes,

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

The Commission considered the adoption of a second resolution suspending the issuance of
Building Permits in the Madison School Project development area. This resolution is to 
prevent new construction or major alterations within the Madison School Project for a period of
15 months. The purpose of this resolution is to prevent construction during the Survey and
Planning period that would void the planning that has previously taken place, or will take
place, in this 15 month period. The suspension of permits is limited to 15 months as this is
the anticipated time to complete the planning and execute a contract with the Federal 
Government.

Commissioner Fountain asked Director of Planning Bills how the 15 month period was determined
and Mr. Bills advised that it is required this planning be completed in 11 months or lose the
Federal Grant and several months leeway was allowed, thereby arriving at the 15 month period.

City Attorney Cory advised that without action on the part of the City Commission no officer
of the City Government would have the authority to withhold a building permit which might be
applied for. He further stated that he had some misgivings about this proposed action as there
was no provision in City Ordinances for withholding building permits other than for violations;
however, under the circumstances, as stated by the Planning Director, it would be like trying to
run water uphill to carry on a plan and survey if permits were to be issued at the same time.

Commissioner Whipple stated that this would not cover an emergency; for instance, if there was
a fire and the owner would need to have a building permit. Mr. Bills stated that this 
resolution would not forestall someone from patching their roof or a similar minor repair and if
there were an emergency and a hardship the person would be allowed to build. Mr. Cory advised
that this resolution is intended for new construction.

Commissioner Fountain moved that the following resolution be adopted and order made:

RESOLUTION SUSPENDING THE ISSUANCE OF
BUILDING PERMITS IN THE MADISON SCHOOL
PROJECT REDEVELOPMENT AREA

WHEREAS, the City of Las Vegas is planning for the clearance and redevelopment of an
urban renewal project known as Madison School, as established by previous action of the Board
of City Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas; and

WHEREAS, the Board of City Commissioners, has determined that the Madison School
Project is a blighted area and is eligible for clearance and redevelopment under Title I of
the Housing Act of 1949 and under Chapter 279 of the Nevada Revised Statutes; and

WHEREAS, the Planning Commission is in the process of preparing a Master Plan for
the City of Las Vegas, and said redevelopment project must conform with the Master Plan; and

WHEREAS, a reasonable period is needed for study and planning of the project area;

and

WHEREAS, the planning for said redevelopment project is proceeding as rapidly as
possible and within the maximum time limitations of the Federal Government, and has not yet
reached a point where zoning, or occupancy, or use of a specific parcel of property can 
definitely be determined; and

WHEREAS, it is both desirable and necessary to maintain the status quo of all

5-6-59
property in said area for a reasonable period to allow for the completion of all required
planning for said project in an efficient, equitable, and economical manner, and the 
issuance of building permits for any purpose during said period will result in changed 
conditions which will prolong said planning for an unreasonable length of time.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of City Commissioners of the City of Las
Vegas, that during the period from the adoption of this Resolution, to and including August,

1960, no Building Permit shall be issued for the construction of any new structure to be
erected or constructed upon any property located within the Madison School Project "Nev. R-6"
and during said period no Building Permit shall be issued for the making of any major improve-
ment of any property, building or structure located within said Madison School Project.

PACKAGE LIQUOR 	The Commission again considered the application of Joseph Julian for a package liquor license at

APPLICATION	the Joe Julian Liquor Store, 2400 South 5th Street. This application was held in abeyance at the

Joe Julian Liquor Store               last meeting of the Board of City Commissioners held April 15, 1959.

Held in Abeyance	Planning Director Bills stated that in regard to the definition of a "Shopping Center" he did not

know of any immediately available authorization for saying something is, or is not, a "Shopping
Center" as such. He added that he would not consider this area a shopping center and would want
to research it further before making a concrete statement to that effect.

Commissioner Sharp referred to a resolution of some years ago that would allow shopping centers
in outlying areas that serve large residential areas to be issued package liquor licenses.

These centers to serve an area of approximately a mile radius and enable them to do their
shopping without going down town. Commissioner Whipple also referred to such a resolution
and stated he believed this application might come under this resolution.

City Attorney Cory asked approximately when this resolution was adopted and Commissioner Sharp
stated that he believed it was in year 1953 or 1954. The Supervisor of License and Revenue, Jean
Dutton, stated that he had researched the City Commission Minutes from 1954 to 1959 and could
not find where this resolution had been adopted.

His Honor Mayor Baker asked if anyone present interested in this application would like to speak.

Myer Cohen addressed the Board stating that he was building the San Francisco Square Shopping
Center and presented the plan to the Commission. He stated it will cover 35,000 sq. ft.; that
there would be 21 stores and a supermarket with 72,000 sq. ft. of parking area. He added that
there is a need for a shopping center in the area consisting of some 5,500 people living there
and San Francisco Square would be very convenient for them to buy most anything they might need
and that they should be able to buy their liquor there. He stated further that there is a 15'
sidewalk and that the Planning Commission is going to allow a 5' sidewalk and that thereby
additional parking could be provided.

5-6-59
At this point there was some question by Planning Director Bills as to the plan as presented
to the Board by Mr. Cohen.

Frank Imperato, operator of Pinky's Liquor Store, 1232 South 5th, stated that there were six
liquor stores in the area already and they are having a tough time now to make ends meet and he
was objecting to this application on that basis.

Sam Zona, one of the operators of the Round Up Liquor Store, 1820 South 5th, stated that if another
liquor store was allowed in the area they would just about have to close their doors.

Joe Julian then spoke to the Commission stating that there is a liquor store right across the
street that has no objection and if there was an objection he would be the one to object. He
added that this is to be a complete shopping center, as Mr. Cohen had said, with all other types
of businesses there.

His Honor Mayor Baker stated that in view of the testimony and the presentation of the plan and
	the uncertainty of the Board that he would suggest deferring the matter to the City Attorney for

further investigation.

Commissioner Sharp moved that application of Joseph Julian for a package liquor license at the
Joe Julian Liquor Store, 2400 South 5th, be held in abeyance.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

	Mr. Kennedy instructed the plan of the shopping center be sent back to the Traffic and Parking

Commission to see if it was the same as the plan approved by them. He stated further that the
ingress and egress does not appear to be the same as it was approved.

Town Tavern, Earl	gaming licenses of Earl Turman, Mary Louise Woodyard, James Monroe Woods, Lorenzo Virgil Spencer,

Mr. Elder's written request he stated that because of its proximity to these uses it is not a
Taylor Corp.	desirable location for residential development, but appears to be a suitable site for a pet

cemetery.

Denied

He further stated it is the intention of the corporation to begin by leasing one acre on a long
term basis with plans for developing the entire 3 acre parcel commensurate with the demand for
this service; offer is $300.00 per annum for this first acre, and as the development proceeds

to leasing it. He suggested that	Mr. Elder prepare a plot plan and submit it to the Planning

CITY-COUNTY FIRE 	His Honor, Mayor Baker, opened the discussion stating that a problem had arisen in regard to the

PROTECTION AGREEMENT	need for a fire protection agreement between the City of Las Vegas and Clark County. He stated

that the purpose of the meeting with the Board of County Commissioners was to discuss what might
be worked out along these lines.

After considerable discussion it was agreed that the City and the County would see that their
respective fire chiefs immediately undertake to cooperate in answering calls in each other's jurisdiction 
	as required and County Commissioner Harley Harmon and City Commissioner Reed Whipple were

designated as a committee to work out the necessary details to be incorporated into a written
agreement.

The possibility of placing the City and County Fire Departments on the same radio band was also
	discussed and it was decided this matter should also be looked into.

Commissioner Sharp then moved that the City Manager and City Attorney be instructed to make up
a cooperative fire protection agreement between the City and the County for presentation to the
Board of City Commissioners and that Commissioner Whipple be appointed as representative of the
City to work with the County in this regard.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT           His Honor, Mayor Baker, reported to those present that it appeared as though more than the 
required signatures to petition for formulation of a Flood Control District had been secured and
Resolution Adopted                that pending certification of the signatures by the County they were now in a position to proceed

with a Watershed and Flood Control District.

Commissioner Fountain moved the following resolution be adopted extending the cooperation of
the City to the County and requesting that the County proceed as rapidly as possible with the
creation of a Flood Control District as prescribed by law:

RESOLUTION

Prevention District for Clark County, Nevada, have petitioned said Board of County Commissioners
of Clark County, Nevada, to establish said district;

NOW, THEREFORE, upon motion duly made, seconded and unanimously carried, it is hereby 
	resolved by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas that said commission and all

employees of said City shall cooperate with the Board of Commissioners of Clark County in all

FARM IRRIGATION SYSTEM	overhead system from Allen Water Well Service Company in the amount of $13,645.88 and had 

sufficient funds to proceed if the Board wished.

Commissioner Whipple stated that he felt there would be more expense with this type of system in
the long run and suggested that rather than proceed with the award of the overhead system the City 
Manager and Director of Public Works see what could be done by way of putting in about 20 acres
of the surface system at a time.

Commissioner Whipple moved that the City Manager and Director of Public Works be authorized to
negotiate for installation of a surface irrigation system on a 20 acre parcel at the Police
Rehabilitation Farm.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

SHOW CAUSE HEARING	At the last regular meeting of the Board of City Commissioners held May 6, 1959, the restaurant

Charleston Inn	beverage license of Marie Rose Phillips doing business as the Charleston Inn, 1107 South 2nd

Marie Rose Phillips                    Street, was suspended effective immediately and licensee ordered to appear at this meeting to show

cause, if any she had, why her restaurant beverage license should hot be revoked. This action was
based on police investigation and report.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple asked if there was anyone present to speak in regard to this Show Cause
Hearing and Marie Rose Phillips spoke on her own behalf. She stated that she knew what the
charges were and the reason her license was suspended; however, she was innocent at the time as	

she was not aware that her restaurant beverage license did not cover the selling of 6-packs of
beer and that she had been operating in this manner for the five years she had been in business.

She stated further that it had not been brought to her attention by the Police Department until
this time.

Chief of Police Sheffer stated that there were 3 separate purchases made by investigators 
consisting of 2 6-packs and 1 fifth of wine, and referred the Commission to photographs of the 
establishment's interior and exterior which indicated more beer being advertised than food.

City Manager Kennedy stated that the licensee must have been informed of the limitations of this
license when it was issued. His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple stated that there was no argument
about the fact that she had sold beer and wine in violation of her existing license and asked
Mrs. Phillips what her intention was and if she thought she could operate successfully without
selling package goods.

Mrs. Phillips stated that she did not need to sell package goods but that she did need the beer
to sell with food. Commissioner Sharp commented that from the looks of the signs, more beer was
being sold than food. Mrs. Phillips answered that the beer companies were very generous with
these signs but that they could come down.

Chief Sheffer added that in addition to the off sale, it is the opinion of the Police Department

5-11-59 and 5-20-59
that this business is being conducted primarily as a tavern and the interior is laid out as a
beer tavern whereas its primary license is for a cafe with beer and wine. Mayor Pro Tem Whipple
asked Mrs. Phillips if she had a lot of customers who come in and buy beer and wine without 
eating and she replied she did have people who came in for beer only but that she did not know it
was wrong to serve it without food. She further stated that there was food available at all
	times.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple stated he was surprised that she did not know her license did not cover this
type of sale in view of the fact this has been going on for so long. Commissioner Sharp stated
there was nothing in the evidence submitted to suggest a restaurant at all. Chief Sheffer added
that the only reference to food was a chili and hamburger sign. Commissioner Fountain said there
was one small hamburger sign outside and seven neon beer signs. Commissioner Sharp stated that
unless this operation is changed something would have to be done.

Mrs. Phillips stated that this business is her livelihood; that she had no record of previous
	arrests and had never had to call the police to her establishment in all these years; that she

	did not want to do anything wrong and that she would comply with the provisions of her license.

Commissioner Fountain advised Mrs. Phillips that this was her first time before the Board of City
Commissioners and it was a matter of whether or not she wanted to cooperate. Commissioner Sharp
instructed Mrs. Phillips to make an appointment with the City Manager to have the exact 
provisions of a restaurant beverage license explained to her.

Commissioner Fountain moved that Marie Rose Phillips, doing business as the Charleston Inn, 1107
South 2nd Street, be allowed to continue business under her restaurant beverage license subject to
a strict police supervision to see that this operation was conducted in accordance with this type
of license, with report to be made by the Police Department to the Board of City Commissioners
at their regular meeting to be held June 17, 1959.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners Fountain,

Sharp, and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes, none. Absent:	Mayor C. D. Baker.

PAYROLL WARRANTS	Commissioner Sharp moved that Payroll Warrant Nos. 35251-35798 for the pay period May 1 - May 15,

Tonopah Highway, legally described as Lot 1, Block 21, portions of Lot 19 and 20,

Block 21, Twin Lakes Village Unit 5, from R-1 to C-1 be denied as recommended by
the Planning Commission.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Fountain Sharp and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes, none.
Absent:	Mayor C. D. Baker.

REZONING (Z-11-59)	The Commission considered the application of F. E. Searway for the reclassification

F. E. Searway	of property generally located on the southwest comer of McWilliams and "H"

Streets, legally described as a portion of N½, SE¼, Section 28, T 20 S, R 61 E,
Approved	from R-1 and R-2 to R-4.

Director of Planning Bills stated that this application was amended at the meeting
of the Planning Commission, with the consent of the owner, to R-3 and recommended
for approval as amended. There was one letter of approval and no protests.

His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple asked if there was anyone present who wished to
speak in regard to this application and Mr. Searway spoke from the audience stating
that he could not say that he was delighted with the amendment to R-3 and thought
he was entitled to R-4; however, he would be satisfied with R-3 and be a "good
little boy".

Commissioner Sharp moved that the application of F. E. Searway for the 
reclassification of property generally located on the southwest comer of McWilliams and "H"

REZONING (2-13-59)	The Commission considered the application of Val Bissonnette for the reclassification

Val Bissonnette	of property generally located on the north side of Encanto Drive between McWilliams

and 9th Streets, and south of Cashman Field, legally described as Lots 3-6,

Approved	Block 4, Biltmore Addition No. 3, from R-1 to R-3. There was one letter of approval 

and no protests to this application.

Director of Planning Bills stated that both the Planning Commission and the Planning
Staff recommended approval of this application but noted that in view of the irregular
shape of the lots, the lack of alley access and an existing utility easement crossing 
the lots, it appeared likely that in processing building permit applications it
might be necessary to restrict the number of units to something less than the 16
units, which this zoning would allow on these four lots.

Commissioner Fountain moved that the application of Val Bissonnette for the 
reclassification of property generally located on the north side of Encanto Drive between
McWilliams and 9th Streets, and south of Cashman Field, legally described as Lots 3 -6,
Block 4., Biltmore Addition No. 3, from R-1 to R-3 be approved as recommended by the

Richard Tam	of property generally located on the north side of San Francisco Avenue and east

of Industrial Road, legally described as a portion of the S½, SE¼, Section 4,

Approved	T 21 S, R 61 E, M.D.B. & M. from R-4 to C-1. Approval recommended by the Planning

Commission. There was one approval and one protest.

Director of Planning Bills explained that a C-1 zoning does not permit a filling
station except by use permit; however, it is his understanding that if this 
application is approved the owner of this property intends to immediately make application
for a permit to allow a filling station. He further explained that is the reason for
the written protest from W. S. Robinson of the Robinson Hotel Apartments, 200-A West
San Francisco Avenue, which he had just presented to the Commission.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple asked if Mr. Tam would still want the C-1 zoning even though
the use permit for the filling station was denied, and a gentleman representing Mr.
Tam stated that he would.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the application of Richard Tam for reclassification of
property generally located on the north side of San Francisco Avenue and east of
Industrial Road, legally described as a portion of the S½, SE¼, Section T 21 S,

R 61 E, M.D.B. & M., from R-4 to C-1 be approved as recommended by the Planning
Commission and the City Attorney instructed to prepare the necessary ordinance
amendment. Also included in this motion was that the letter received from W. S.
Robinson be filed with the City Clerk and Board of Zoning Adjustment.

some of the church trustees to meet with the Board in the Mayor's office at 7:00 p.m.
on March 11, 1959. Director of Planning Bills stated that it was the understanding
of the Planning Commission that during this meeting on March 11, 1959, the Board of
City Commissioners agreed to waive the other conditions, provided the 20' 
dedication of right-of-way for street purposes was consummated. Mr. Bills advised that
the City now has received a Quitclaim Deed executed by the officers of the Nevada-
Sierra Baptist Convention dedicating this right-of-way.

FREMONT STREET LIGHTING	The Commission considered the report on petition for proposed street lighting 

Proposed Assessment	installation on Fremont Street from 6th Street to the intersection with East

District 100-28	Charleston Boulevard, Assessment District 100-28. Director of Public Works Sauer

stated that of the 86 owners, 51.1% were in favor (44), 10.5% were not in favor (9)
Held in Abeyance	and 38.4% gave no reply (33). On the basis of front footage the percentage would

be 54.9% for, 12.4% against, and 32.7% no reply.

Mr. Harold Stocker spoke to the Commission stating that when the improvement dis-
trict was created by the State Highway Department from 15th Street to the City
Limits on Fremont, they were supposedly at some future time to continue it on to
5th Street. He stated that he was in favor of the street lighting on Fremont
but he thought now was the time to widen it 10' and make an avenue out of it
instead of a street. He added that he owns 300' frontage on Fremont and asked
why an assessment district could not be created to widen the street 10', and if
necessary give 5' setback at the same time, as well as install the new street
lighting.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple stated if this is ever to be done it should be done now and
Commissioner Fountain agreed.

Mr. John Franklin, representing the Franklin Motel, 1028 Fremont, and also speak-
ing for the owner of the Traveler's Hotel Court, 1100 Fremont, stated they were in
favor of widening Fremont all the way up to 7th Street instead of 5th Street. Mr.
Stocker stated that about 50% of the sidewalk area is gravel or grass and that
would be about 7'. City Manager Kennedy advised that from 5th to 7th Street
the parking could be eliminated to attain the required width.

Commissioner Sharp questioned the possibility of the State Highway Department
doing this street widening, and City Manager Kennedy advised that this is a
State Highway but he did not think they would do it.

Director of Public Works Sauer stated that 10' additional would not allow another
traffic lane, and Commissioner Sharp stated that it would make two traffic lanes
	on each side whereas now there is only one. Mr. Stocker was of the opinion it

would increase the traffic on Fremont by 70%.

Commissioner Fountain moved that this matter be held in abeyance for further study.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Fountain, Sharp and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes,
none.

CONNIE MORMON CHILD	City Attorney Calvin Cory advised the Board of Commissioners that City Ordinance

NURSERY LICENSES	requires a unanimous vote of all members of the Commission hearing evidence 

presented in order to revoke a business license.

Charges Dismissed

Mr. Cory further advised the Board that Mayor C. D. Baker had heard evidence 
presented at the Show Cause Hearing held at the regular meeting of the Board of City
Commissioners on April 15, 1959, with regard to Connie Mormon's nursery licenses at
the Las Vegas Children's Nursery, 827 South 7th Street, and Happy House, 516 North
9th Street, but that he would be unable to vote on the matter inasmuch as he was
out of the country and would not return until his term of office had expired.

5-20-59
Commissioner Fountain moved that the charges as set forth in the Show Cause
order issued April 3, 1959, be dismissed at this time without prejudice as
recommended by the City Attorney.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Fountain; Sharp and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes;
none. Absent:	Mayor C. D. Baker.

PETITION	His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple presented a petition to the Board signed by 

Charles and Ann Connery	residents in the vicinity of East Ogden and Harley Way protesting the condition of

1601 Ogden Ave.	property at 1601 Ogden Avenue; occupied by the Charles Connery family, which 

mentions the fact that City Forces have tried several times during the past four or
Notice to be served	five years to correct these conditions without any lasting success. Mayor Pro

Tem Whipple suggested more stringent measures be taken and that the occupants be
informed to keep the property cleaned up or cite them into Court.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple asked if anyone was present representing the owners of the
property and City Manager Kennedy informed the Board that the owners live in
Wyoming and that Mr. and Mrs. Connery, who reside there, were presently out of
town as they had to take their little girl to the City of Hope for a heart operation. 
He added that someone had cleaned the place up a little and that some of
the neighbors had offered to help but were turned down.

Commissioner Fountain moved that Mr. and Mrs. Charles Connery, 1601 Ogden Avenue,
be served notice that unless the property is cleaned up within 24 hours after
being served with notice they would be cited into court under provisions of City
Ordinance.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Fountain, Sharp and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes,
none. Absent:	Mayor C. D. Baker.

Mr. Earl Bohne spoke from the audience stating that he wished to clarify certain
statements made in the paper and that there had been no threats; merely this 
petition to help the property owners in the area rectify this situation. He was of
the opinion that all had been very tolerant requested help from the various 
departments rather than quarrel over the back fence. He stated further that they were
appreciative of the problems of this large family, but that as time went by 
conditions grew worse and worse until one by one neighbors called for assistance from
the City Departments who in turn notified these occupants and they promised 
cooperation but this did not last. He added that they, as neighbors, still tried to
be of assistance to the family but it was received with a shrug of the shoulders.

Mr. Bohne continued that unfortunately, when they started this action, they did not
know the child was being operated on at the City of Hope on this day; however, he
still felt that this presents a serious problem and for the health of their own
children, should be eliminated. He concluded with the statement that they had a
list of violations but did not feel it necessary to enumerate them here as they
were sure the Commission knew what needed to be done.

EMERGENCY ORDINANCE NO. 794            City Attorney Calvin Cory advised the Board that it would be necessary to adopt
Amendment to Emergency	Emergency Ordinance No. 794 amending Emergency Ordinance No. 788 Creating 

Ordinance No. 788 Creating	Assessment District 100-43, Street Lighting on Main Street from Bonanza to Owens. He

Assessment District No.	stated further that the City Charter requires the Mayor and three members of the

100-43	Commission, or at least four Commissioners, to vote on all measures on the levying

of taxes; therefore, notices cannot be sent out as originally provided in Emergency
Adopted	Ordinance No. 788, and the purpose of this amendment is to extend the sending of

3 R M 61 Kohler Electric Plant be approved.

UNITED FUND	City Manager Kennedy presented a letter addressed to the Mayor and Board of City

Community Service Building Commissioners from A. G. Neumeyer, Chairman, Capital Funds Committee of the United

Fund, requesting a meeting date be set between the Board of City Commissioners and
the United Fund Capital Funds Committee to discuss location of a proposed United
Fund Community Service Building to house participating agencies and other 
community service agencies.

City Manager Kennedy explained that this has reference to 10 acres of City land in
the vicinity of San Francisco and Eastern Avenue as a site for this proposed 
building. He added that the United Fund believed they could build this building and
pay for it by rents that are being paid out for different community functions and
have a very nice building.

Commissioner Sharp suggested that they be familiarized with the laws on the sale
of public land. He also said that it might be possible this particular land might
be unsafe for building. Mr. Kennedy stated that this was not a part of a corner
that has proved dangerous but it is the best comer of the 40 acres.

His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple was of the opinion that the request for this 
meeting should be deferred until a full Board is present, and that Mr. Kennedy should
write a letter to the United Fund to this effect.

RICHARD CLOUGH PROPERTY       City Manager Kennedy advised the Board that at the regular meeting of the Board of
FOR ALLEY PURPOSES	City Commissioners held March 18, 1959, the City Attorney was instructed to write a

letter offering Richard Clough $3,500.00 for his property which is needed for the
Held in Abeyance	continuation of the alley in back of North Main Street between Mesquite and

Bonanza. This appraisal of $3,500.00 by Drury and Associates was directed at the
Commission meeting held December 17, 1958. City Attorney was further instructed
to start condemnation proceedings if this was not acceptable.

Mr. Kennedy stated that this offer had been made and refused by Mr. Clough as he
valued the property at $15,000.00, and he asked the Board if condemnation 
proceedings should be initiated, stating that Drury and Associates would appear as the
appraiser.

Commissioner Fountain asked if this same property was appraised some 7 or 8 years

3-20-59
ago, and Mr. Kennedy stated that it was as he remembered it approximately $1,800.00
or $2,000.00, and at that time Mr. Clough wanted about $10,000.00. He stated that
he would get the exact figures and send them to Commissioner Fountain. Commissioner
Fountain stated that he personally believed this property worth more than $3,500.00
but not $15,000.00, and that he thought the appraisal was too low.

Mr. Kennedy advised that the matter would have to be settled by a judge in court and
that he usually took a third party to check on it. He hesitated because once the
appraisal was made by the judge himself that would be it, and the alley property
might be appraised the same as the front property.

His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple asked if there was a possibility of the property
owner getting his own appraiser and perhaps the City could get together with him
on a value. Mr. Kennedy answered that this could be done but he did not believe
a figure much below $15,000.00 could be attained.

Commissioner Sharp stated that if it would be condemned it would be necessary to
put $3,500.00 in escrow. Commissioner Fountain stated that there should be a
happy medium somewhere. Mr. Kennedy stated that he had a call from Mr. Clough's
attorney after he had received the offer of $3,500.00 and was informed that Mr.

Clough would not accept less than $15,000.00. Mayor Pro Tem Whipple stated that
it was a question whether or not the Commission wished to go to condemnation on
this property.

Commissioner Fountain moved that this matter be held in abeyance.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Fountain, Sharp and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes, none.
Absent:	Mayor C. D. Baker.

GENERAL FUND BALANCE         City Manager Kennedy reported that after Service and Material and Payroll Warrants

were taken out, the General Fund Balance as of May 15, 1959, was $924,835.47; 
there was a refund of $366.66 to Floyd J. Cope under refund of liquor license for
unused portion of liquor license fee, and a refund of $210.00 to Mr. Cope under 
refund of gaming license for unused portion of gaming license.

OIL SURFACING LAMB BLVD. City Manager Kennedy presented a request for approval of Purchase Requisition No.
Purchase Requisition 5598 to Palomar Oil Refining Corp., Bakersfield, California, for 270 tons SC3 oil

at $30.30 per ton, making a total of $8,181.00 for road mix surfacing of Lamb
Approved	Boulevard from Owens Avenue to East Charleston Boulevard, 30 feet wide. Ground

base and equipment for placing of surface to be performed by Clark County Road
Department, under joint agreement.

Mr. Kennedy advised that County Forces have put the road into place but could not
spend money that was not agreed on. This purchase requisition is for the oil, which
they will lay, and road mix. City Forces will help haul some of the top paving
material.

Mr. Kennedy continued that they are now going to work to continue this road from
Charleston to Boulder Highway.

Commissioner Sharp asked if this was the City's share according to the agreement
with the County.

Mr. Kennedy replied in the affirmative and went on to say that in regard to Lamb
Boulevard and Mojave, 25th Street cannot be improved in any manner and that an 
assessment district cannot be created for it; therefore, it will have to be replaced and
later rebuilt. He added that Charleston and 25th Street have more traffic than they
can handle.

Commissioner Fountain stated that he had a question and that was for this amount of
money there must have been a reason why they did not go out to bid. Mr. Kennedy
answered that we have a contract on this oil and that it might be that the cost would
be $1.00 a ton more. He further stated that the County is going to do the mixing and
the company they get their material from have about the same prices. He said that the
Douglas Compary price would be about $32.00 per ton.

Commissioner Sharp asked what the right-of-way on these streets was and Director of
Public Works Sauer stated it was 80' on Lamb Boulevard and 112' on Mojave Road. 
Commissioner Sharp added that he sure hated to see these temporary things go in but did
not know what could be done. Mr. Sauer said that it is a 3" road mix and could be
added to. Mr. Kennedy agreed that road mix is not the ideal street and that it is
temporary but that it would hold quite a bit of traffic for a number of years.

Commissioner Fountain moved that Purchase Requisition No. 5598 to Palomar Oil Refining
Corp., Bakersfield, California, for 270 tons SC3 oil at $30.30 per ton; total,

$8,181.00 be approved.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Fountain, Sharp and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes, none. Absent:
Mayor C. D. Baker.

Approved	lodging at $20.00 per day, or a total of $60.00 to be paid to David Kennedy;

REZONING (Z-10-59)               The Commission considered the application of M. S. McCoy for the reclassification of
M. S. McCoy	property located at the northeast comer of West Charleston and Rancho Road from R-E

to C-1.

Approved

Planning Director Bills advised that there were eight protests and approximately 
fifty-three in favor of this rezoning. Mr. Bills advised further that a special committee
from the Planning Commission had studied and investigated this rezoning and it was
the recommendation of the Planning Commission that it be approved subject to the
following conditions:

1.	That the property be used strictly for the proposed use of a drive-in
branch bank.

2.	That the building conform to all City Ordinances and building codes
including setbacks, landscaping, signs, traffic and parking facilities, 
etc.

His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple asked if there was anyone present who wished to
protest this rezoning and Mr. Murle Perry, 2318 Sherman Place, presented the Board
a petition in protest, stating that it was his opinion this area should be strictly
residential. He said that he lived in the McNeil Tract adjacent to the property in
question and he received notice of this proposed rezoning.

Commissioner Fountain asked Planning Director Bills if the favorable petitions were
on file and he replied that there was a petition, some letters, and also personal
appearances in favor, totalling 53 in all.

Mrs. Stephanie Hurley spoke in protest and was of the opinion that many signed the
petition in favor of this rezoning thinking it was against making this commercial.

She added that this was a most unrealistic approach in dropping from R-E to C-1 and
stated that this corner was most dangerous. She referred to many recent rezonings
which might be all right as they now stand but thought the zoning ordinance should
be upheld when surrounding property is affected and certain rezoning applications
should be denied on the grounds that they are not in the public interest.

Mr. Perry again spoke to the Board in regard to procuring enough signers to reject
a rezoning such as this as the signers he had on the petition he presented to the
Commission were from his block only, but that with adequate time he believed he
could get signers all the way to Westleigh.

Mr. Art Ham, Jr., attorney for the Bank of Nevada who now has the property in
question in escrow, spoke, to the Commission stating that he believed this was 
exaggerated. He further stated that Mrs. Hurley's protest had been heard by the
Planning Commission and yet this application had been approved unanimously. He
believed that what they were afraid of was subsequent rezonings. He added that the
33 in favor were voluntary signatures from people who want the bank there, and that
rather than a hazard this rezoning would take away a traffic problem in that the
use would be limited to that of a drive-in bank. He stated that there were some
people who wanted all of Charleston zoned Commercial and some that wanted none of
it zoned Commercial, but stated he was sure the City Commission and Planning 
Commission would give appropriate protection to the residents in the area.

Mrs. Hurley mentioned that the signatures in favor of this particular rezoning were
signed by people that want all of Charleston Commercial. She added that this

6-3-39
location was selected by a group from a depositors insurance corporation from
Washington who were not concerned with the growth of our city and that they could
not care less if this was a traffic problem at this corner. She stated that she
must take exception to Mr. Ham's suggestion that this would not complicate traffic
and that it was her opinion that a drive-in bank would make it worse.

His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple asked if there were any other statements to be made
and Mr. Perry stated that he was not familiar with the proceedings of this Board but
that they had gotten along without this bank for many years and would like to get a
postponement so people in the neighborhood could know what is happening. He stated
that he was not at the first meeting of the Planning Commission as he did not under-
stand the meaning of the tract letter he received and that it meant very little to
him. He asked, if possible, to have a postponement of this rezoning.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple answered that he did not know of any great benefit to be 
derived from a postponement and that there had been considerable in the papers and
much discussion about it. Commissioner Fountain added that there had been one 
public hearing and this matter had been before the Planning Commission on two 
occasions.

Commissioner Fountain moved that the application of M. S. McCoy for the 
reclassification of property located at the northeast corner of West Charleston and Rancho
Road from R-E to C-1 be approved subject to the following conditions, and City
Attorney instructed to prepare the necessary ordinance amendment:

1.	That the property be used strictly for the proposed use of a drive-in
branch bank.

2.	That the building conform to all City Ordinances and building codes
including setbacks, landscaping, signs, traffic and parking facilities, 
etc.

Commissioner Whipple stated that he would like to vacate the chair to his colleague,
Commissioner Sharp. He commented that not very long ago there was an application
for a service station on this comer and he believed they would continue to get
applications for this property and that he could not help but think that a 
development of this type would be much more desirable than a service station. He further
stated that perhaps this would be a solution at least to an end to this matter 
continually coming before the Board for rezoning for different purposes. He stated it
was his opinion that this property would never be suitable for residential, for
which it is now zoned, and that in a lot of these matters some feel they would be
beneficial and some feel they would not. He added that there was not a full board
	present but this could not be helped due to resignations and elections; therefore,

he stated that he would second the motion, and it was carried by the following vote:
Commissioner Fountain and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes, none.
Commissioner Sharp stated that his firm has done business in the past for the Bank
of Nevada and is doing this bank; therefore, he passed his vote. Absent:	Mayor

C. D. Baker.

Francis York	of property located at 226 South 2nd, legally described as Lots 20 and 21, Block

13, Clark's Las Vegas Townsite, from C-1 to C-2.

Approved

Planning Director Bills stated that the Planning Commission recommended approval
and indicated that similar consideration would be given to the rest of this block
but this could not be done at this time as it would have to be readvertised and 
  public hearing held according to law. He added that rezoning from C-1 to C-2 would
permit construction of a commercial hotel operation which is not actually permitted
in C-1 and if permitted would require off-street parking and it was felt this parking
was not needed. C-2 zoning would not require off-street parking.

Commissioner Sharp stated that in time this area should all be zoned C-2. Mayor Pro
Tem Whipple asked Mr. Bills if there were any protests and he replied that there were
none.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the application of Francis York for the reclassification

Sterns

Director of Planning Bills stated that R-2-T zoning provides that an application can
Approved	be made for a use permit to put in a Trailer Court. He added that the Planning

Commission recommended approval. In regard to two protests received he stated that
these protestants had horses and stables and they were afraid occupants of a trailer
court would object to their horses. Mayor Pro Tem Whipple asked if there was anyone
present who wished to object and there was none.

Commissioner Fountain moved that the application of W. S. Rash, Jr. and Sam and
Frances Stems for the reclassification of property located on the south side of
East Bonanza Road, west of Nellis Boulevard, from RE to R-2-T be approved and City
Attorney instructed to prepare the necessary ordinance amendment.

July 15, 1959	City Attorney Calvin Cory advised that date for public hearing should be set for

July 15, 1959, as it is required that not more than 40 or less than 30 days notice

Commissioner Sharp moved that the petition for the vacation of the west 10' of
 right-of-way on the west side of South 13th Street between Charleston and Bonneville be
approved and Public Hearing be held at 7:30 p.m. on July 13, 1959, at the regular

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Fountain, Sharp and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes,
none. Absent:	Mayor C. D. Baker.

CHARLESTON ESTATES #1            The Commission considered the tentative map for Charleston Estates #1 submitted by
Tentative Map	Ernest Becker containing approximately 8 lots located north of Alta Drive immediately

east of the Red Rock School property. Approval was recommended by the Planning
Approved	Commission subject to the installation of all offsite improvements for the complete

street by the developer.

Planning Director Bills stated that this subdivision involved a trading of properties
between the School District and Mr. Becker and an agreement was reached whereby, if

6-3-59
Mr. Becker agreed to put in the improvements on the School Board's half of the street,
it would satisfy the School District requirements for a prior tentative map of Mr.
Becker's. This agreement which had been arrived at appeared to be acceptable to all
concerned. Mr. Bills added that he had received a letter from Mr. Becker confirming
this agreement.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the tentative map for Charleston Estates #1 be approved
subject to the installation of all offsite improvements for the complete street by
the developer as recommended by the Planning Commission.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Fountain, Sharp and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes, none.
Absent:	Mayor C. D. Baker.

USE PERMIT U-17-58	The Commission considered the application of the Greater Faith Baptist Church for

Greater Faith Baptist	approval of a new and different plot plan. This use permit was approved by the Board

Church	of City Commissioners at their regular meeting held December 17,1958, for the 

construction of a church at the southeast corner of Highland Drive and Jefferson Avenue,

New Plot Plan	on the condition that they conform to the plot plan which was submitted at that time.

Approved

Planning Director Bills stated that a building permit had not been issued; however, the
footings had been poured and their location does not conform to the approved plot
	plan, consequently, they were now asking for approval of this new plan. He added

that the Building Department stated that the footings are not structurally adequate
and did not meet the code for the proposed church.

Mr. Bills explained that through some misunderstanding the church did not understand
that a building permit was required and construction was started contrary to the 
original plot plan. This matter was then discussed with Reverend P. S. Walker and he 
submitted an alternate plan showing the building to be constructed according to the way
the footings were put in. The Board of Zoning Adjustment did not approve this plan;
however, they recommended approval if the east setback be increased to 13' and the south
setback to 17' which would conform to the normal 10% side yard requirements. There
were no protests.

Reverend Walker was present and stated that he was of the opinion that the footings
were adequate, and Mayor Pro Tem Whipple reminded him that they did not meet the
requirements according to City standards. Mr. Bills stated that the plans called
for 12" x 24" footings whereas 10" x 16" were put in. Reverend Walker stated it
would be difficult to destroy what had been done and in regard to the 3' and 5'
they were off on the placement of the footings that it seemed they should be able
to get together.

Commissioner Sharp reminded him that in December this setback was agreed to and
that was one of the conditions on which the use permit was approved. Commissioner
Sharp further advised him that he should have consulted the City Department before
he decided to make his own changes. City Manager Kennedy reminded Reverend Walker
	that it would be necessary to get a building permit.

	Commissioner Sharp moved that this new plan be approved subject to the conditions

that the east setback be increased to 13' and the south setback to 17' which would
conform to the normal 10% side yard requirements and that the use of the footings
that have been poured be disapproved inasmuch as they do not allow the proper 
setback and are not structurally adequate and do not meet the code for the proposed
church.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Fountain, Sharp and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes,
none. Absent:	Mayor C. D. Baker.

VARIANCE (V-7-59)	The Commission considered	the application	of	Nick Romer for a variance to construct

Nick Komer	a building with 5' of the	rear property line	on property located at 1121 South 3rd

between Charleston and 4th Place, legally described as Lot 8, Block 21, Boulder
Referred to Traffic and                   Addition in an R-4 zone.

Parking Commission

Planning Director Bills stated that the Board of Zoning Adjustment recommended
approval; and that there were two protests; however, it is recommended that this
application be referred to the Traffic and Parking Commission in regard to off-street
parking requirements.

His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple asked if Mr. Romer was present and he was not.

VARIANCE (V-8-59)	The Commission considered the application of Martin Kutzen for a variance to enclose

Martin Kutzen	an existing, legal, nonconforming carport on property located at 3317 West Charleston

Blvd., legally described as Lot 13, Block 1, Westleigh Subdivision #1 in an R-1
Approved	zone. The Board of Zoning Adjustment recommended approval subject to conformance

to the plot plan as submitted. There were no protests.

Planning Director Bills explained that the variance for the carport was approved
two or three years ago and now Mr. Kutzen wishes to enclose it for use as a family
room.

Commissioner Fountain moved that the application of Martin Kutzen for a variance to
enclose an existing, legal, nonconforming carport on property located at 3317 West
Charleston Blvd., legally described as Lot 13, Block 1, Westleigh Subdivision #1
in an R-l zone be approved subject to conformance to the plot plan as submitted.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Fountain, Sharp and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes, none.
Absent:	Mayor C. D. Baker.

VARIANCE (V 9-59)	The Commission considered the application of Ben Bergan for a variance to construct an

Ben Bergan	addition to an existing duplex within the required side yard, 3' from the side property 

line on property located at 217 South 13th Street, legally described as Lot 5,
Approved	Block 11, Ladd Addition, in an R-4 zone. The Board of Zoning Adjustment recommended
approval. There were two protests.

Planning Director Bills stated that the existing building is 3' from the lot line;
however, original building was to be 5' as required.

Mr. Bergan took the floor and stated that he wished to build in line with the 
existing dwelling and that he had $550.00 invested in the addition as of this time. He
added that Mr. LeRoy Whipple's complaint was based on the fact that he was required
to build within the requirements of the ordinance. Mr. Bergan explained further
that the inspector was there three times when the original structure was built and
never said anything.

Commissioner Sharp stated the building permit showed this addition was to be 5' from
the property line and it was then discovered the building was 3' from the property
line. He added that there were a number of instances where houses built before the
setback ordinance were built 3' from the property lines. Mr. Bergan stated that if
this variance could be allowed then he could build this addition in line with the
existing building.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the application of Ben Bergan for a variance to 
construct an addition to an existing duplex within the required side yard, 3' from the
side property line on property located at 217 South 13th Street, legally described
as Lot 3, Block 11, Ladd Addition, in an R-4 zone, be approved as recommended by
the Board of Zoning Adjustment.

Commissioners Fountain and Sharp voting aye; His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting no.

Approved	Section 3, T 21 S, R 61 E, M.D.B. & M. in an R-1 zone. The Board of Zoning Adjustment 

recommended approval. There were no protests.

Planning Director Bills stated that the question arose as to whether or not five
years from now the applicant would want to build in what will now be his side yard,
if our records would be sufficient to show that he would not be allowed to do so.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple asked if anyone was present to protest this application, and
there was not.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the application of Clifford R. Skoglund for a variance
to interchange a side and rear yard at property generally located at the northeast
comer of 6th and St. Louis, legally described as a portion of the NWment , SEment , Section
3, T 21 S, R 61 E, M.D.B. & M. in an R-1 zone be approved as recommended by the

ANNEXATION PETITION	Planning Director Franklin Bills presented the petition of T-J Enterprises, T. K.

T-J Enterprises	Wong, President, for the annexation of approximately 120 acres generally located on

(A-1-59)	the south side of San Francisco west of Rancho Road and legally described as the

W½, NE¼, NE¼, NE¼ and that portion of the SE¼, NE¼ lying west of the proposed Inter-
Abeyance	state Freeway, Section 8, T 21 S, R 61 E.

Mr. Bills stated that this was the first time annexation of property south of San
Francisco Avenue had been considered. He added that the drainage, sewers, fire and
police protection had been checked and that this area was closer to downtown Las
Vegas than some of the other tracts.

6-17-59
Director of Public Works Sauer advised it would be possible to connect sewer lines
in this tract to an existing line on Rancho Road on a temporary basis and that the
San Francisco main interceptor line would be installed in a year or two.

Mr. Bills stated that this proposed annexation would probably preclude Federal Aid
Secondary Funds for San Francisco Avenue; however, this factor should not be used as
a basis for recommending denial of this annexation as sometime in the future San
Francisco will be placed on the Federal Primary System which does not preclude the use
of funds in urban areas.

Mr. Bills advised that the Planning Commission recommended approval; however, further,
recommended that the resolution of intent to annex be deferred until the possibility
and feasibility to include the Golden Gate Industrial Tract which is contiguous
immediately to the east could be investigated. Mr. Bills stated further that the
description presently furnished by the petitioner was not sufficiently detailed and
defined to permit its use in resolution of intent to annex as the "westerly line of
the proposed U. S. Freeway" would not be sufficient to record an annexation and he
had advised their engineer to submit a more detailed description.

Commissioner Fountain moved that petition of the T-J Enterprises for the annexation
of approximately 120 acres generally located on the south side of San Francisco
west of Rancho Road be held in abeyance pending a more detailed legal description
and pending investigation of the possibility of including the Golden Gate Industrial
Tract in this annexation.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Elwell and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain and His Honor Acting Mayor Pro Tem Sharp voting aye; noes,
none. Absent:	Mayor C. D. Baker and Mayor Pro Tem Reed Whipple.

CHARLESTON HEIGHTS #8             Planning Director Bills presented the revised tentative map of a portion of
Revised Tentative Map                  Charleston Heights #8 submitted by the Land O' Sun Land Company. A previous 
tentative map, including this property, and other units of Charleston Heights #8 was
Approved	formerly approved by the Planning Commission and the Board of City Commissioners.

Mr. Bills explained that this revision consisted merely of a redesign of the lots
which would permit the addition of two lots. He stated further that this subdivision
would have a private water supply and when final map is approved there should be some
agreement in this regard similar to the one we have with Golfridge Terrace Unit #1.

Commissioner Fountain moved that the revised tentative map for Charleston Heights #8
be approved subject to agreement being signed by subdivider guarantying water supply
prior to approval of final map.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Elwell and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain and His Honor Acting Mayor Pro Tem Sharp voting aye; noes,
none. Absent:	Mayor C. D. Baker and Mayor Pro Tem Reed Whipple.

VARIANCE (V-7-59)	The Commission again considered the application of Nick Komer for a variance	to 

Nick Komer	construct a building within 5' of the rear property	line on property located at	1121

South 3rd between Charleston and 4th Place, legally described as Lot 8, Block 21,
Referred to Board of	Boulder Addition in an R-4 zone. There were two	protests. Approval was recommended

Zoning Adjustment	by Board of Adjustment; however, application was	referred to the Traffic and	Parking

Commission by the Board of City Commissioners at their regular meeting held June 3,
1959, for study in regard to off-street parking requirements.

Planning Director Bills stated that the proposed parking was in direct violation of
the parking provisions of the zoning ordinance which does not allow backing over the
sidewalk; therefore, the Traffic and Parking Commission recommended denial. The
applicant said he would revise his plans and only build four units thereby only requiring 
four pairing spaces; however, according to his plans, he would still have
improper parking and a building permit could not be issued.

Commissioner Fountain moved that the application of Nick Komer for a variance to
construct a building within 5' of the rear property line on property located at
1121 South 3rd between Charleston and 4th Place, be referred back to the Board of
Zoning Adjustment for further study.

GENERAL FUND BALANCE           City Manager Kennedy reported that the General Fund Balance as of June 15, 1959,

was $773,003.97, and that there were no refunds and no disbursements from Bond
Funds or Special Assessment Funds.

COUNTRY CHURCH	City Manager Kennedy advised the Board that an application had been received on May

DAY CENTER	26, 1959, from Reverend W. H. Higginbotham of the International Church of the Four

Square Gospel for a nursery license at the Country Church Day Center, 318 South
Nursery License Fee	11th Street.	Mr. Kennedy further advised	that no fee had been charged this nursery

Required	to date, and	it was being operated by the	Reverend's wife and a charge of $3.00

per day for each child was being made; all revenue going to the church fund.

Mr. Kennedy advised that there were certain establishments not required to pay the
regular nursery license fee; namely, the Variety Day School which is a true nonprofit 
operation with many people leaving their children there without charge, and
the other, the Jewish Community Center School which is not a true nursery because
of their educational program for which they have fully State accredited teachers
operating an educational type program.

Mr. Kennedy felt that in view of the fact that the Country Church Day Center did
charge a fee which went into the church treasury, it would be in direct competition
with commercial nurseries and believed the regular nursery license fee should be
required.

Commissioner Fountain moved that the regular nursery license fee for the Country
Church Day Center be required.

Approved

This application was previously recommended for denial by the Board of Zoning 
Adjustment and tabled by the City Commission on June 18, 1958, on the basis that there was
insufficient off-street parking. Director of Planning Bills stated that a new plot
plan had been submitted which showed a satisfactory arrangement and provided for
17 usable parking spaces. Mr. Bills added that this application was again reviewed

7-1-59
by the Board of Zoning Adjustment and they recommended approval subject to

permit additional units in fill conformance with the ordinance and on the basis that
granting permission to convert accessory buildings into dwelling units in violation

USE PERMIT U-15-59	The Commission considered the application of E. F. Lied for a Use Permit to construct

E. F. Lied	and operate a service station on property generally located at the northeast comer

of 14th Street and East Charleston Boulevard, legally described as a portion of the
Approved	SE¼, SW¼, SW¼, Section 35, T 20 S, R 61 E, in a C-1 zone, being 125' on East

Charleston and 135' on South 14th Street.

Planning Director Bills stated that the Board of Zoning Adjustment recommended 
approval of this use permit subject to certain conditions, one of which was the 
dedication of a 20' east-west alley across the rear of the filling station property.

He added that there were no protests to this application.

Mr. Robert Bigelow, representing Mr. Lied, addressed the Commission stating that
they did not feel that the alley should be put in at this time and added that the
property goes clear to Clark Street and development of the other property has not
been completed. He stated that at the present time there is an interested party
from Salt Lake City contemplating a department store in this location; however,
these plans were indefinite. He was of the opinion that this alley would go nowhere
and would serve no purpose, and suggested some sort of an agreement so the 
dedication and improvement of this alley could be entered into when the proper time comes.

Mr. Bills stated that it had been his experience that any time commercial property
was developed, if alley dedication and agreement for improvements of same was not
procured, difficulties were later encountered. He added that this alley might not
go anywhere now, but that if one was not started there never would be one.

After some discussion the City Attorney was requested to draw up an agreement 
stating that this alley would be put in and improved at such time as the City requested
it, and that the exact location be set forth in this agreement and bond posted to
guarantee this; the amount of the bond to be determined by the Engineering 
Department. If a change in the location of the alley should be determined later, the
agreement could be subsequently changed.

Commissioner Fountain moved that the application of E. F. Lied for a Use Permit to
construct and operate a service station on property generally located at the northeast 
corner of 14th Street and East Charleston Boulevard, legally described as a
portion of the SE¼ , SW¼, SW¼, Section 35; T 20 S, R 61 E, in a C-1 zone, being 125'
on East Charleston and 135' on South 14th Street, be approved subject to the 
following conditions:

1.	Conformance with the plot plan as submitted.

2.	Conformance with the provisions of the fire code and the recommendations of
the Fire Department.

3.	Signing of an improvement agreement and posting of bond for sidewalks on the
14th Street side and driveway openings and any other improvements as 
recommended by the Engineering Department as set forth in said improvement agreement.

4.       Signing of an agreement and posting of a bond guarantying alley dedication
and improvement at such time as required.

USE PERMIT U-2-57	The Commission considered the revocation of Use Permit (U-2-57) to Virginia Ball

Virginia Ball	for the operation of a wedding chapel at 222 South 2nd Street in a C-1 zone which

was granted by the Board of City Commissioners on March 6, 1957, subject to the
Revoked	condition that an improvement agreement be signed and a bond posted for the 

installation of offsite improvements.

The improvement agreement was signed by Mrs. Ball and United Pacific Insurance Company
Bond No. 293179 was posted in the amount of $652.53; however, the improvements were
never installed and Mrs. Ball has moved from this location. Furthermore, she signed
the application for the use permit as owner of the property whereas she was not the
owner. Consequently, the City Attorney's Office concluded that the use permit should
be revoked because it was obtained on the basis of misrepresentation.

Commissioner Fountain moved that Use Permit (U-2-57) granted to Virginia Ball for
the operation, of a wedding chapel at 222 South 2nd Street be revoked.

of the Madison School Urban Renewal Project. He added that the funds to be used are
part of the Federal Government Planning Advance Loan which had already been approved.

Mr. Bills stated that they had experienced extreme difficulty in getting a temporary
staff for these studies and it was his personal recommendation that this could be
done cheaper and faster and more efficiently by consultants who work with this sort
of thing every day.

His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple asked if this would come back before the Board of
City Commissioners, and Mr. Bills said that it would.

Commissioner Fountain moved that the Coordinator of Urban Renewal be permitted to
negotiate for these services and findings to be presented to the City Commission
for final approval.

GRANT, BARGAIN AND	The Commission considered the approval of Grant, Bargain and Sale Deed on Option #1

SALE DEED	with the Housing Authority for the sale of property generally located at 28th Street

Housing Authority	and Charleston Boulevard. It was requested that Mayor and City Clerk be authorized

to sign this deed so that escrow could be entered into for delivery upon receipt of
Approved	payment.

Mr. Louis G. Biel, 2502 Sunrise Avenue, addressed the Board stating that he was a
property owner in this area and that he would like to protest the sale of this 
property to the Housing Authority and he did not approve of this action.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple advised him that the Commission was just acting on the option
to sell this property to the Housing Authority and a public hearing would be held by
the Planning Commission when rezoning application was made.

Commissioner Fountain moved that the Grant, Bargain and Sale Deed be approved for
Option #1 with the Housing Authority for the sale of property generally located at
28th Street and Charleston, and the Mayor and City Clerk authorized to sign same
with the understanding that a public hearing will be held for the rezoning when such
application is made.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Elwell and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting aye; noes, none.
Commissioner Sharp passed his vote by reason that his firm is doing business with
the Housing Authority. Absent:	Mayor C. D. Baker.

Later at this meeting Mr. James Hogan, 2528 Sunrise Avenue, asked if this matter
could not be reconsidered. He was of the opinion that in selling this land to the
Housing Authority of the Federal Government, there was no doubt that it was to be
used for low-cost housing units and this would be ruinous to the surrounding 
property owners.

City Attorney Calvin Cory stated the City was legally bound to sell this property
under the option agreement entered into several months ago. Mr. Hogan asked why
they were not notified and Mr. Cory advised him the City could sell property to
anyone and was not required to serve notices or hold public hearing.

After some discussion it was decided that the Housing Authority should be notified
of these protests before escrow was entered into.

   Meeting to be held the assessment by approximately $4.00 per front foot to property owners concerned.

Director of Public Works Sauer advised letters had been sent to all owners to determine 
if they wished the widening in addition to the street lighting but replies had
not been received.

The Commission requested that Mr. Kennedy arrange a meeting with the Engineering
Department, Finance Department and himself, and notify all property owners concerned,
by mail, to attend this meeting to see if they wanted to go ahead with the proposed
assessment district.

requested that action be taken to start a regular assessment district.

Adopted

At the regular meeting of the Board of City Commissioners held October 1, 1958, this
petition for creation of assessment district for these street improvements signed
by Philip H. Empey, Julia S. Huffey and Jerome D. Mack, was referred to the City
Manager and Director of Public Works.

Commissioner Whipple asked if the improvements for this block could not be included
in another assessment district and Mr. Kennedy advised that former City Attorney,
Howard Cannon, had ruled this could not be done unless the district was adjacent
or reasonably close to another assessment district. In this particular case, all
of the adjacent area had already been developed.

Commissioner Sharp moved the following Resolution of Intent for Assessment District
for street improvements on Bracken Avenue between 6th and 7th Streets be adopted and
order made:

CIGARETTE VENDING	The Commission considered the application of Ralph T. Warne, H. O. Hart, Raymond

OPERATORS APPLICATION	Finn and E. E. Sportsman for a cigarette vending operators license for the Nevada

New	Vending Machine Company, 8 East Charleston Boulevard. Police report on this 

application was unfavorable.

Nevada Vending Machine Co.

Commissioner Sharp asked if Mr. Hart was present as there were some questions they
Denied	wished to ask him. He asked Mr. Hart if when he talked to him yesterday he stated

7-13-59
he had loaned Smokey Cigarette Company machines because they did not have machines
to fill those locations and Mr. Hart replied that was true. Commissioner Sharp
asked further where these locations were and Mr. Hart mentioned the Main One-Stop
Service Station and the motel across from the Showboat and others he could not
recall without the records; however, he stated they were not the ones listed on the
Smokey Cigarette Company's applications. Commissioner Sharp stated further that
these were not his locations but the machines were his and that he had loaned them
to the Smokey Cigarette Compary and Mr. Hart answered that was true.

At this point Commissioner Sharp produced an affidavit from Ray Eckl of the Smokey
Cigarette Company which he asked Chief of Police Ray Sheffer to read, which he did
in part as follows:

"That on or about the 26th day of June, 1959, I was approached by one Ralph T. (Red)
Warne who, due to his having had a license issued and then informed later that the
license was issued in error and because of this having to remove his machine from
the Shamrock, asked me if I would install a machine in the Shamrock Bar until such
time as Nevada Vending was approved for a license to operate their own business.

This I agreed to do and the machine installed in the Shamrock is my own machine".

Commissioner Sharp asked if any stock of this corporation had been issued to anyone
other than those listed on the application of the Nevada Vending Machine Company and
Mr. Hart stated they had had application from two people to buy stock but they had
found out they could not do this without police report.

Commissioner Fountain asked Mr. Hart if	they did have stock up	for	sale	and Mr.

Hart answered yes, 30 shares at $10.00 a share. Mr. Hart said	the	 facts in the

affidavit were not exactly correct and that under the agreement with Mr. Eckl if
they did not get their license, he would still have these locations. Commissioner
Sharp asked if Mr. Eckl received any money for the machines placed by him and Mr.

Hart answered the amount had not been agreed upon but that he would get a 
consideration for it.

Commissioner Whipple stated the crux of	the matter was whether	Mr.	Hart	made an

agreement, verbal or otherwise, and did	he go cut and solicit under the	name of the

Smokey Cigarette Compary. Mr. Hart stated they never entered into such an agreement;
that Mr. Warne and Mr. Eckl had talked together; and further that no locations were
solicited besides those which they had procured during the time they thought they
were licensed.

Commissioner Whipple said if someone would do this in their name it was subterfuge
on their part. Mr. Hart stated there were a lot of things on record that did not
look very good and mentioned the police investigation and the time wasted in getting
a certain letter written and then it was written to the wrong place. He added they
were put behind the 8-ball due to their inefficiency.

Commissioner Sharp stated he resented this inference about the "inefficiency" of
the Police Department. Mr. Hart continued that in this case he said "inefficiency"
and he meant just that, but in some matters the Police Department was doing a fine
job.

Commissioner Fountain moved that due to the fact the Commission had an unfavorable
police report on the Nevada Vending Machine Company the application for a cigarette
vending operators license be denied.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none. Commissioner Whipple qualified his vote stating that he had not had a
chance to study the police report and Mr. Eckl's affidavit but on the face of it he
felt there was an involvement.

SMOKEY CIGARETTE COMPANY   Commissioner Whipple stated that in all fairness the owner of the Smokey Cigarette

Company should be asked to appear at the next Commission Meeting so they could find
Cited to Show Cause	out about this matter.

Commissioner Whipple moved Ray Eckl, owner, Smokey Cigarette Company, be cited to
appear before the Board of Commissioners at 7:30 p.m. on the 5th day of August, 1959,
to show cause, if any he had, why his cigarette vending machine operators license
should not be revoked.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none.

Policy Established

Ordinance to be Studied                Commissioner Whipple asked if it would be legal not to accept a license application,

and Mr. Cory advised that unless the ordinance was amended the application would have
to be accepted; however, his opinion was a policy could be established whereby the
application could be accepted but not acted upon until such time as the ordinance

7-15-59
or ordinances could be studied and amended.

Commissioner Fountain stated that he would be in favor of this as long as it would
not affect any present licensees. Jean Dutton, Supervisor of License and Revenue,
stated that to his knowledge there were no applications of this type presently in
process.

Commissioner Whipple moved as a policy of the Board the License Department and City
Manager be instructed not to submit to the Commission any applications for used 
furniture and appliances licenses or for firearms permits until the ordinance can be
studied.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain with the stipulation that this is not to
affect anyone licensed at this time, and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye; noes, none.

REZONING (Z-16-59)                 The Commission considered the application of the Home Investment Company of Long
Home Investment Company	Beach for the reclassification of a portion of the east one-half of Section 26,

of Long Beach	T 20 S, R 61 E, generally described as a strip of land approximately 350' wide

along the west side of 25th Street between Harris and Searles, from R-3 to R-1.

Approved

Director of Planning, Franklin Bills, advised the Commission Mr. R. D. Whaley
wishes to develop the portion of Greater Las Vegas Tract No. 3 as single family
homes. There were no protests and the Planning Commission recommended approval.

Commissioner Fountain moved the application of the Home Investment Company of Long
Beach for the reclassification of a portion of the east one-half of Section 26,

T 20 S, R 61 E, generally described as a strip of land approximately 350' wide
along the west side of 25th Street between Harris and Searles, from R-3 to R-1
be approved and the City Attorney instructed to prepare the necessary ordinance.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none.

REZONING (Z-17-59)	The Commission considered the application of D. H. Brockley and James Fellers for

D. H. Brockley and	reclassification of Lot 1 and Lot 46, Block 1, Paradise Village #2, generally

James Fellers	located on San Francisco between Santa Clara and Santa Paula, from R-1 to R-2.

Denied	Planning Director Bills stated this area presently had zonings of R-1, R-2, R-3,

R-4). and Commercial very close together and the Planning Commission recommended
denial at this time with the further recommendation that this rezoning application
be reconsidered after the completion of the Master Plan. There was one protest
received by the Planning Commission.

Commissioner Whipple moved the application of D. H. Brockley and James Fellers for
reclassification of Lot 1 and Lot 46, Block 1, Paradise Village #2, generally located
on San Francisco between Santa Clara and Santa Paula, from R-1 to R-2 be denied as
recommended by the Planning Commission.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none.

REZONING (Z-17-59)	The Commission considered the application of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Reno for

Roman Catholic Bishop	the reclassification of a portion of the NW¼, SE¼, Section 28, T 20 S, R 61 E,

of Reno	generally located between McWilliams and Washington, approximately 193' east of

Highland Drive from RE to R-1 and R-2.

Denied

Planning Director Bills advised the Commission that numerous people appeared at the
Planning Commission Public Hearing held July 9, 1959, and a petition had been submitted 
which, after being analyzed by the Planning Department, indicated that 243
property owners protested, 42 of which owned property in Bonanza Village, 62 south
of Washington Avenue, 118 in Twin Lakes Village which is one-half mile distant, and
21 property owners in the County and/or in the City at least two miles distant.

Commissioner Sharp stated this was the site proposed for additional low-cost housing
by the Housing Authority. He continued that it had been foreseen with the advent of
the freeway and urban renewal problem there was a need for such housing; however, in
view of all the protests this particular area could not be approved.

Commissioner Fountain made the motion that all assistance be sought from City Hall,
Engineering Department, Right-of-Way Department, to help the Housing Authority find
another suitable site to relocate this particular project.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Elwell and carried by the following vote: 
Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none.

Mrs. Peggy Petrie of 1709 East Elm spoke to the Commission stating that she had some
points in rebuttal to the Bonanza Village protests. These were that this site proposed 
by Housing Authority had all the facilities needed for a low-income housing
project; she showed the Commission some snapshots of the area involved. Mrs. Petrie
stated further that any justified protest should have come from Marble Manor, and
also the low-cost housing project had been started there long before Bonanza Village.
She presented a petition in favor of this site and said she had found out the people
of Las Vegas want this low-income housing project and feel this would be a good site
and they do not want a delay in the freeway. She concluded that the signers on
this petition are from all over this community.

Mr. McLaughlin spoke in protest to this rezoning and stated that the property owners
in the area affected were not coming across town to mind someone else's business.

One thing which he wished noted was that the applicant for the change in the zoning,
if approved, would sell this land to the Housing Authority at twice the going rate
for land in the area. He added that he could see a need for additional housing if

7-15-59
the freeway developed as it is now proposed; however, he did not see that it was
reasonable to expect that this housing project would be held until the removal of
these people from that area.

Mr. McLaughlin stated that he very much appreciated Commissioner Sharp's motion and
he thought this was a sensible approach to the problem; and further, that he would
suggest denial of this rezoning and then intensify the search for another location.
He continued they were not here to debate whether or not to have public housing but
the question was a matter of good City planning and it was a fundamental principle
of good planning that various land uses cannot be mixed and if this should happen
property value would be reduced to the lowest common denominator. He concluded with
the point that the Planning Commission had recommended denial and they would request
denial of the rezoning and then employ all facilities available to the activity of
     finding another suitable location.

Mayor Gragson asked if there was anyone else in favor of the rezoning who wished to
speak and Msgr. Lamb asked on what grounds was the petition taken against this
rezoning; were they against low-cost housing or the occupants of the low-cost
housing. He added that he hated to be controversial.

Commissioner Sharp stated that in regard to the tremendously high purchase price
mentioned by Mr. McLaughlin he wished to advise under Federal law the land would
have to be appraised and bought at that figure. Mr. McLaughlin stated that he
understood the price was $4,000.00 an acre and if this was correct he would suggest
it was above the price of land in the area, which he believed generally could be
bought for $2,500.00 an acre.

Commissioner Fountain said he appreciated the fine work of the Housing Authority in
the City of Las Vegas, and he also believed the Planning Department had done a
wonderful job. He stated all of the people were familiar with the situation and
was of the opinion there were many sites that might be suitable for this project.

He added that he could not conscientiously go against the recommendation of the
Planning Commission.

Commissioner Fountain moved the application of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Reno
for reclassification of a portion of the NW¼, SE¼, Section 28, T 20 S, R 61 E,

generally located between McWilliams and Washington, from RE to R-1	and R-2	be

denied as recommended by the Planning Commission.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Elwell and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye; noes,
none. Commissioner Whipple qualified his vote stating in his opinion there was a
great need for additional public housing for the displacement and rehabilitation
program and all people should be vitally interested and help them to locate a
place for it. Commissioner Sharp passed his vote stating he was in agreement but
was not voting by reason that his firm is doing business with the Housing Authority.

REZONING	(Z-13-59)	The Commission considered the request of the Planning Commission to	rescind	their

Richard	Tam	approval of Rezoning 2-13-59 which was given at the City Commission	Meeting	of	May

20, 1959. This rezoning application was submitted by Richard Tam for reclassification 
Approval Rescinded                  of property north of San Francisco Avenue, between Fairfield Avenue and

Industrial Road, from R-4 to C-1 and was previously approved by the Planning
Commission on April 14th, 1959. This rezoning was included in a proposed ordinance
presently in committee, and action on this proposed ordinance, which would make
this rezoning official, was held in abeyance at the Commission Meeting held on
July 1, 1959.

Mr. Bills advised the Board that subsequent to the aforementioned approvals, the
owner submitted an application for a use permit to construct a filling station
which the Planning Commission felt was in direct conflict with the representation
made by the owner at the time of the public hearing.

This matter was again considered and discussed by the Planning Commission on July
9, 1959, and it was voted unanimously to rescind its recommendation of approval
and requested that the City Commission also rescind its approval of this rezoning
and eliminate it from the proposed ordinance and refer this matter back to the
Planning Commission for further study.

Commissioner Sharp moved the approval of Rezoning Z-13-59 given on May 20, 1959, be
rescinded and same be eliminated from the proposed ordinance and referred back to
the Planning Commission for further study.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Elwell and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none.

LIQUOR APPLICATION               The Commission considered the application of Joseph Julian for a package liquor

New	and beer bar license at the Joe Julian Liquor Store, 2400 Las Vegas Boulevard South.

	There was a favorable police report on the applicant. This application was held in

Joe Julian Liquor Store                    abeyance at the regular meetings of the Board of City Commissioners held April 15

and May 6, 1959.

Continued to later in

this meeting	Sam Taylor, Secretary of the Clark County Licensed Beverage Association, addressed

the Commission stating reasons why this application should be denied. He stated
according to the present liquor ordinance there were no licenses of this type
available at this time and that what constitutes a shopping center has not been
clearly defined. He continued that outlying shopping centers eligibility for this
type of a license should be at the discretion of the Board and that many applications

7-15-59
in this area had been consistently denied due to the density of liquor stores
located there.

With reference to a statement made by Mr. Julian at a previous Commission meeting
that there was no objection from the liquor store operator across the street from
this location, Mr. Taylor advised that Mr. Pete Reed, the operator of this establishment, 
was ill with a touch of pneumonia and was unable to appear personally to
protest. Subsequently, Mr. Reed wrote a letter to the Commission stating his
objections, and Mr. Taylor stated Mr. Reed was present at this time and would
like to speak to the Commission.

Mr. Pete Reed made a statement to the Board that he felt it would be a threat to
his economy if this application was approved and requested the Commission to give
this matter due consideration before issuing this license.

Mr. Taylor presented a map he had obtained from Mr. Bills, Director of Planning,
showing one and one-half square miles of the area concerned with a population of
7500 people. He stated there are presently nine package liquor stores and four
taverns, not including grocery stores that sell liquor or eating places that
serve beer and wine, in this area.

Mr. Taylor continued that there were five liquor stores in the Strip area and
mentioned them by name. He concluded that his statement was based on facts and
requested this application be denied.

Madison Graves, Attorney, spoke on the behalf of Joseph Julian, stating that he
did not think the licenses in the County had any influence on this Commission and
further, that Mr. Taylor was wrong in his facts and Jean Dutton could verify this.

He stated there were presently 43 package liquor licenses issued and based on
population of 45,000; if one such license per 1,000 population there would be
two such licenses available. He mentioned that a recent figure of 55,000 population 
given out by the Chamber of Commerce might possibly mean there were 12 more
available.

Mr. Graves continued that the area of the Francisco Square Shopping Center is twice
the area of Market Town which is considered a shopping center. He was of the opinion
this application should be approved based on the precedent of Market Town, and
believed this was similar to the policy applied in the case of a 100-room hotel.

Mr. Graves thought the type of shop Joe Julian was going to have would be a credit
to the City and he mentioned the fact there was a favorable police report on the
applicant.

He concluded this was a desirable area and he felt Joe Julian was qualified and
this application should be approved; further, that this was the third time the
application had been before the Commission and it was desired that it should be
acted upon at this time,

Mr. Murray Peterson of the Round-Up Liquor Store stated a letter of protest to
this application had been sent to the Commission and he wanted to make it plain
they were not interested in another liquor store in this area. He added that they
pay high taxes and worked hard to make a living and operate properly. He continued
that he had no quarrel with Mr. Julian or Mr. Graves but believed careful consideration 
should be given this application and that this Commission was not tied by any
precedence.

Commissioner Sharp asked Joseph Julian if he would be the sole owner and operator
of this establishment and he replied in the affirmative. City Attorney Cory asked
about the slot machines he might install and Mr. Julian advised there would be no
percentages by anyone. Mr. Julian stated his residence was 129 North 21st Street.

Commissioner Whipple stated in the last several years, 10 applicants had been turned
down because of the excess of such establishments in this area and it made it difficult 
to grant this one and face those applicants previously denied.

Mr. Julian stated that he would not have made application if this had not been a
shopping center; that there were 6,900 people living in the area and a liquor store
would be a convenience to them as there is every other type of store in this center.

He also stated the way the law read he believed this application should be approved.

Commissioner Fountain stated he believed action should be taken and moved the 
application of Joseph Julian for a package liquor and beer bar license at the Joe Julian
Liquor Store, 2400 Las Vegas Boulevard South, be approved as it was to be located in
a shopping center.

There was no second to this motion and the Mayor declared the motion had failed for
the want of a second and stated this matter would be referred back to later at this
meeting.

BEL AIR #5	Commissioner Sharp moved the Bel-Air #5 Tentative Map submitted by the Highland

TENTATIVE MAP	Development Company for property generally located between 17th Street and Burnham,

Bracken and Oakey, comprising of 22 acres, be approved as recommended by the 
Approved	Planning Commission subject to the following conditions:

1.	That the developer be responsible for the improvement of the existing 
dedicated rights-of-way within the general area of the subdivision but which are

   not a part thereof; namely, Bruce Street for a distance of approximately 100'
north and south of Oakey and the west one-half of Burnham for a distance
approximately 100' north and south of Oakey.

2.	Extension of Bracken westward to South 17th Street.

3.	Making Spencer Street to conform to City specifications of 51' minimum width.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none.

7-15-59
ANNEXATION A-2-59	The Commission considered the petitions	of James Cashman, Sr., W. G. Sholes and

Portion of Winchester	Robert L. Bigelow for the annexation of	a portion of the Unincorporated Township

Township	of Winchester, legally described as the	NE¼ of the NE¼ and a portion of the SE¼

of the NE¼, Section 6, T 21 S, R 61 E.

Approved

Director of Planning Bills advised that the Board of Clark County Commissioners, at
Proposed Ordinance	their first regular meeting in July, adopted a resolution authorizing the detachment

Referred to Committee                 of this property from the Unincorporated Township of Winchester for the purpose of

annexation by the City of Las Vegas. The City has six months in which to annex,
and if not annexed, the property would revert back to the Township of Winchester.

Mr. Bills further stated the residents in the area, not included in this annexation,
indicated overwhelmingly they wished to remain in the County. In regard to the
request of Marion A. Schneider for the annexation of property in this area, this
could not be included in this annexation as it was less than 60 acres required by
State Law for detachment from the unincorporated township and could not be included
as the District Attorney and City Attorney advised it was not contiguous to it.

Commissioner Whipple moved the petition of James Cashman, Sr., W. G. Sholes and
Robert L. Bigelow for the annexation of a portion of the Unincorporated Township
of Winchester, legally described as the NE¼ of the NE¼ and a portion of the SE¼,

NE¼, Section 6, T 21 S, R 61 E, be approved and the proposed ordinance acted upon
at the Special Meeting of the Commission to be held July 22, 1959.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none.

An Ordinance entitled:	AN ORDINANCE ANNEXING TO, AND MAKING A PART OF THE CITY OF

LAS VEGAS, CERTAIN SPECIFICALLY DESCRIBED TERRITORY ADJOINING AND CONTIGUOUS TO
THE CORPORATE LIMITS OF THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS; DECLARING SAID TERRITORY AND
INHABITANTS TO BE ANNEXED THERETO AND SUBJECT TO ALL THE LAWS AND ORDINANCES;
ORDERING A PLAT SHOWING SAID TERRITORY TO BE RECORDED IN THE OFFICE OF THE COUNTY
RECORDER OF THE COUNTY OF CLARK, STATE OF NEVADA; AND PROVIDING OTHER MATTERS
PROPERLY RELATED THERETO, was read by title and referred to Commissioners Whipple
and Sharp, committee for recommendation.

ONE-HOUR PARKING	The Commission considered the request of Marco Rosato for one-hour parking zone on

South 1st; 300 Block	both sides of the 300 Block of South 1st Street between Bridger and Lewis as 

recommended for approval by the Traffic and Parking Commission.

Approved

Planning Director Bills stated seven property owners were in favor, three were not
in favor and there was no replies from three. He stated a portion of this block
had an existing one-hour parking zone and this would complete the remainder.

Commissioner Fountain moved a one-hour parking zone on both sides of the 300 Block
of South 1st Street between Bridger and Lewis be approved as recommended by the
Traffic and Parking Commission.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none.

NO-PARKING ZONE	The Commission considered the recommendation of the Traffic and Parking Commission

Francisco Square	for the installation of a no-parking zone along the north side of San Francisco

Shopping Center Area               Avenue between Fairfield and Las Vegas Boulevard South, and along the west side

of Las Vegas Boulevard South, between San Francisco and Cincinnati. This area is
Approved	the east and south boundary of the Francisco Square Shopping Center and this 

noparking zone would make available an additional traffic lane which will facilitate
turning requirements. Mr. Bills stated there would be no need for curb parking
in view of the parking lot.

Commissioner Whipple moved a no-parking zone along the north side of San Francisco
Avenue between Fairfield and Las Vegas Boulevard South, and along the west side of
Las Vegas Boulevard South, between San Francisco and Cincinnati, be approved.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Elwell and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none.

URBAN RENEWAL	Director of Planning Franklin Bills, Coordinator of Urban Renewal, presented the

MADISON SCHOOL PROJECT       recommendation that the City enter into a contract with the Western Real Estate

Research Corporation of Los Angeles, California, in the amount of $5,500.00 to
Western Real Estate	prepare the necessary land acquisition appraisals for the Madison School Urban

Corporation Contract	Renewal Project. It was requested that the Mayor and City Clerk be authorized

to sign a standard form contract approved by the Housing and Home Finance Agency
Approved	and also by the City Attorney.

Mr. Bills stated they had tried to get a local appraiser; however, of the five
interested, three of them could not fully meet the qualifications for this kind of
appraisal work. One appraiser (until recently a local appraiser) did not act
particularly interested and never submitted a proposal in writing. The fifth
appraiser, George Von Tobel, indicated that he had too much regular work and
could not possibly undertake this contract.

Mr. Bills added that they then went outside of this locality to the Western Real
Estate Research Corporation of Los Angeles which is one of the top appraisal firms
in. the United States and experienced in this type of work. Their proposed fee was
lower than any qualified local appraiser. They offered to do the work in ninety
days for a base fee of $5,000.00 and out-of-pocket expenses, not to exceed $500.00;
a fee of $75.00 for any additional appraisals of unimproved land and $125.00 for
any additional appraisals of improved parcels; their fee for court procedures would
be $100.00 per day or $75.00 for half day, which is a standard fee with every
appraiser, in the event we would go into the execution stage and have to go into
condemnation suit.

7-15-59
Mr. Bills was of the opinion that the City was very fortunate to get this firm
to do this work and do it immediately, and requested this contract be entered
into with the Western Real Estate Research Corporation and the Mayor and City
Clerk authorized to sign same. He stated further that these funds are budgeted
out of the Federal Government Planning Advance Loan.

Commissioner Whipple moved that the recommendation of the Coordinator of Urban
Renewal, that the City enter into a contract with the Western Real Estate Research
Corporation of Los Angeles in the amount of $3,300.00, to prepare the necessary
land acquisition appraisals for the Madison School Urban Renewal Project, be
approved and the Mayor and City Clerk be authorized to sign same.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none. Commissioner Sharp stated he was voting "aye" because all local
resources had been exhausted as he was not in favor of approving contracts outside
of the City of Las Vegas.

URBAN RENEWAL	Director of Planning Franklin Bills, Coordinator of Urban Renewal, presented the

MADISON SCHOOL PROJECT       recommendation that the City enter into a contract with Candueb and Fleissig, Urban

Renewal Consultants of Newark, New Jersey, in the amount of $19,000.00 to make the
Candueb and Fleissig	necessary studies and prepare reports on general planning, land acquisition and

Contract	disposition, and family relocation needed to complete the final planning of the

Madison School Urban Renewal Project.

Approved

Mr. Bills stated that a number of reputable consultants had been contacted and out
of the several, two proposals had been received that would merit serious considera-
tion. These proposals were submitted by EBASCO Services, Inc., of New York, and
from the firm of Candueb and Fleissig, Newark, New Jersey, both of which are
nationally recognized and doing a lot of work in this field. These firms submitted
identical proposals of $19,000.00. Mr. Bills continued that this might sound like
a substantial figure; however, he advised the Board that they had included 
approximately $23,000.00 in their approved budget for the Federal Government Planning
Advance Loan for temporary staff for this work which would be used for this purpose.

Mr. Bills added that this matter had been discussed with the principals of both
firms as to how they would proceed with this contract and recommended in the best
interest of the City to enter into a contract with the firm of Candueb and Fleissig.
This firm would be ready to begin with this work immediately and we do have a 
deadline and must have this work completed by February 15, 1960, that must be considered
in view of the Capital Grant Reservation for this project by the Housing and Home
Finance Agency. Mr. Bills informed the Board that Mr. Candueb was present and would
be willing to answer ary questions in regard to this contract.

Commissioner Fountain moved the recommendation of the Coordinator of Urban Renewal
for permission to enter into a contract with Candueb and Fleissig, in the amount of
$19,000.00 to make the necessary studies and prepare reports on general planning,
land acquisition and disposition and family relocation needed to complete the final
planning of the Madison School Urban Renewal Project be approved and the Mayor and
City Clerk authorized to sign same.

PURCHASE REQUISITION	Director of	Public Works Sauer	requested approval of purchase	requisition for the

Painting Roof of	application	of aluminum pigment paint to the roof of the City	Hall to the DiBiase

City Hall	Contracting	Company, 345 West	Colorado Street, in the amount	of $1,506.22.

Held in Abeyance	Mr. Sauer advised this was the	lowest informal bid received.	He further stated

the roof of the recreation hall and police station were also in need of a similar
coating; however, it was decided to request this just for the City Hall to see how
it would actually hold up. He continued that this was an asphalt base aluminum
paint with asbestos fibers.

Commissioner Sharp was of the opinion this would not do the job and stated the
School Board had experience with various surfacings which had proven very 
unsatisfactory and the cost was more to keep repainting than putting on a real good roof
in the first place. He doubted if any guarantee would be given that this surfacing
would hold up for any length of time. Mr. Sauer stated the roofs were not completely 
gone but was of the opinion such a surfacing would make the roof last.

It was decided to hold this matter for further investigation and study.

PURCHASE REQUISITION           The Commission considered a request from the Public Works Department for approval
Insecticide Machine	of purchase requisition for an insecticide machine for the Street Department to

the Buffalo Turbine Agricultural Equipment Company, Inc., Gowanda, New York, in
Approved	the estimated amount of $3,156.00.

City Manager Kennedy advised the Board the machine we now have would not do the
job as it could not be used very long at one time and it took the crew three days
to cover the City. He believed it could be sold for use in smaller area. Commissioner 
Whipple asked if it would be of any value to keep it for emergencies. Mr.
Kennedy suggested a possibility for its use at the prison farm but for emergencies
it would do no better than it did now.

Commissioner Fountain moved the request from the Public Works Department be approved
and authorization given for purchase requisition for an insecticide machine to the
Buffalo Turbine Agricultural Equipment Company, Inc., Gowanda, New York, in an
estimated amount of $3,156.00.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none.

THE WESTERNER	City Manager Kennedy presented a request of The Westerner Club, Inc., for the City

Change in Corporation	Commission to rescind their approval given July 1, 1959, for a change in corporation

Ownership	ownership, and approve the corporation ownership as it was prior to that date.

Approved	Mr. Kennedy advised the Board that on July 2, 1959, the new officers took over this

club and a few days later an error in the amount of $100,000.00 was discovered in
the legal papers covering the transaction, which could not be settled, and by
mutual agreement it was decided to revert back to the original owners. Mr. Kennedy
continued that the principals involved had been in to see him to discuss the matter.

Commissioner Fountain asked if it might not be necessary for them to make new 
application. Mr. Kennedy stated one of the corporate owners was included in the 
ownership both times and was of the opinion a new application would not be necessary
but they should be given thirty days in which to file a financial statement for the
Westerner Club, Inc., as well as a financial statement for each of the people that
are in the corporation.	^ -

Commissioner Fountain moved the approval given July 1, 1959, for a change in the
corporation ownership of The Westerner Club be rescinded and the corporation 
ownership as it was prior to that date be approved; and further that a financial 
statement for The Westerner Club, Inc., as well as a financial statement for each of the
people that are in the corporation, be filed with the City in thirty days.

date be set between the Board of City Commissioners and the United Fund Capital

Building	Building to house participating agencies and other community service agencies.

This matter was discussed at the City Commission Meeting held May 20, 1959, and
deferred until there would be a full Board present.

Commissioner Elwell asked the City Attorney if the City had the right to give
property for such a use and Mr. Cory stated he would like to have the opportunity
to check this out. Commissioner Whipple was of the opinion they should meet with
them and after some discussion it was decided the City Manager should set up a
meeting and in the meantime asked Mr. Cory to investigate the legal aspect.

RECREATION DEPARTMENT           Commissioner Whipple moved the request from the Recreation Department to go to bid

YOUTH ADVISORY COUNCIL              City Manager Kennedy advised the Commission that the Youth Advisory Council respectfully 
Juvenile Problems	recommended to the Mayor and City Commissioners the adoption of more aggressive

action towards juveniles by all local agencies concerned with juvenile problems,
Resolution Adopted and              including District Judges.

50 Deputies Authorized

Commissioner Whipple stated they had a proposed resolution in regard to the 
recommendation of the Youth Advisory Council and City Attorney read the resolution.

Commissioner Whipple moved the following resolution be adopted and order made:

"WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas has heretofore
provided for the control of juvenile activities on the streets, alleys, parks and
other public places in the City of Las Vegas by the enactment of a curfew which must
be observed by both children and parents alike; and

WHEREAS, organized juvenile gangs and gathering of hoodlums have become 
prevalent throughout the City and have created a serious problem in the enforcement of the
public peace and the security of the citizens of Las Vegas; and

WHEREAS, all of such activities are in violation of law and contrary to the best
interests of the public welfare; and

WHEREAS, the Police Department of the City of Las Vegas is ready, willing and
able to enforce the ordinances of said City, in cooperation with all other public
authorities and agencies of the State and of the County, including the juvenile
court of this judicial district;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of the City of
Las Vegas hereby directs the police department and all other public officials of
said City to enforce each and every ordinance of said City, and in particular, to
strictly enforce the ordinance pertaining to a curfew for juveniles, and to do all
other things permitted by law to abolish organized gangs of juvenile hoodlums, as
well as adult violators of law in the City of Las Vegas.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas
hereby expresses its willingness and determination to give all possible assistance
and backing to the Police Department of the City of Las Vegas in carrying out this
Resolution and hereby urges the Police Department of the City of Las Vegas to disband 
loitering groups whenever and wherever found in the City of Las Vegas engaging
in any unlawful activity.

PASSED, ADOPTED AND APPROVED this 15th day of July, 1959."

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none.

A lady from the audience asked the Board if there was a set penalty for violation
of the curfew law and, if so, why it had not been enforced.

City Attorney Cory stated the City has had a curfew ordinance for many years. Under
our law any child under the age of 12 picked up after the hour of 10:00 p.m. must
be surrendered to his parents; if they are not at home he would be taken to the
Juvenile Home. Any child between the ages of 12 and 18 would be taken to the
Juvenile Home. In both instances the officer is required to make a report to the
office of the Juvenile Probation Office of Clark County and the Eighth Judicial
District Court of Clark County.

Mr. Cory continued that the child was not jailed and he was released by the Juvenile
Probation Officer upon the request of the parents or an officer of the Eighth
Judicial District Court, and the City has no control over him.

7-15-59
A young man by the name of Frank Hyers spoke from the audience asking why the Police
Department was down on one club because of the incident at Park Paseo as others had
been there hours upon hours and were not picked up — just the Esquires.

Chief of Police, Ray Sheffer, stated that Park Paseo had been patrolled regularly
and he doubted it was known by the Police Department what club or group was involved
in this particular incident. He added the Esquires was one of several in the Police
Department files and no mention of any individual group had been made by his department. 
Chief Sheffer said the instructions to officers were to disband unruly groups
and prevent loitering in any City park.

Frank Hyers stated that it had been implied and when he was arrested the officers
said they were after the Esquires. Chief Sheffer replied that he did not know about
this and that orders from his office were to pick up whatever groups were causing
trouble. Frank Hyers asked if the Police Department had given the information to
the Review Journal and further, if they would have to break up their club.

Commissioner Whipple asked what was the purpose of the Club and he stated it was a
social club just like any other, and they held dances. Commissioner Whipple also
asked if any of his club members were implicated in the Park Paseo incident and he
answered in the affirmative. When Commissioner Fountain asked if he could justify
his actions concerning the entering of someone's property he replied he was not on
the property but was in the street by the curb.

City Attorney Cory advised that 10:00 p.m. was the curfew Sunday through Thursday
and 12:00 p.m. on Friday and Saturday; however, this could be extended to 1:00 a.m.
for a special event if written request was made to the Police Department by the
principal or superintendent of a high school. Notice of such an extension would
be published in the newspaper.

Commissioner Whipple said he was mindful of the fact there were many good young
people in the City of Las Vegas but in regard to the destruction of property and
the rights of property owners something would have to be done and he moved the
Chief of Police be authorized to deputize up to 50 men from the City to work and
cooperate with the Police Department and support this resolution.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none.

Commissioner Sharp said he had talked to youths and grownups alike and if anyone
had suggestions regarding this problem the Commission would appreciate hearing from
them or they could get in contact with the City Manager. He thought the people of
the City should let the District Court know how they feel about the handling of
the Juvenile Court and the Court should be more stringent in its decisions.

SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT	Mr. Kennedy advised the Commission the Supplemental Agreement which was approved

City of North Las Vegas	at the meeting of July 1, 1959, was for 50 years from the date of the original

agreement which was April 7, 1952, and the City of North Las Vegas needed to have
Approved	this extension for 50 years from the present date in order to qualify for Federal

Funds.

Commissioner Sharp moved the Mayor and City Clerk be authorized to sign a supplemental
agreement to an existing agreement between the City of Las Vegas and the City of North
Las Vegas extending this agreement for 50 years from this date.

Motion seconded ty Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:

Commissioner Elwell moved the application of Joseph Julian for a package liquor and
Denied	beer bar license at 2400 Las Vegas Boulevard South be denied.

Attorney Graves stood up and requested that Commissioner Elwell's motion be disqualified 
because of his connection with the retail liquor association. Commissioner
Elwell informed him that he had resigned from that organization prior to his election
to office. City Attorney Cory stated there was nothing in the law to prevent Commissioner 
Elwell from making whatever motion he might choose.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye; noes, none. 
Commissioners Fountain and Sharp passed their vote.

Joseph Julian asked if there was any reason why the second portion of this 
application for a beer bar could not be granted and Jean Dutton, Supervisor of License
and Revenue, advised there was no such license set up by ordinance.

Madison Graves stated that he did not quite understand the status of the record and
asked if the City Attorney had been requested for a definition of a shopping center.
He added there was no definition provided and according to the ordinance a shopping
center was eligible for this type of license. Mr. Graves asked City Attorney Cory
if he did not consider this a shopping center.

Mr. Cory replied that in his opinion, and in common parlance, he believed this was
a shopping center.

GENERAL FUND BALANCE City Manager Kennedy stated the General Fund Balance, after Service and Material

and Payroll Warrants, was $536,559.16, He added this was an estimated figure because
the final audit was to be made around July 15, 1959; and a true figure would be had

There was a refund to William Hale in the amount of $33.34, and to Keith Richards
in the amount of $275.00, which were refunds on liquor licenses, and a refund on
Gaming License to William Hale in the amount of $33.33. Mr. Kennedy stated there

ELDORADO ADVISORY             City Manager	Kennedy advised that Mr. Vic Uehling from the Engineering Department

appointed to this committee. He stated he would like to have Mr. Uehling continue
 that which he had been carrying out in the past and the Commission was in agreement
with this.

CHARLESTON AND RANCHO	City Manager Kennedy presented a proposed traffic channelization study to smooth the

ROAD INTERSECTION	flow of traffic at the intersection of Rancho Road and Charleston Boulevard. He

stated this had been presented to the Planning Commission and the Traffic and Parking
Appraisal of	Commission. These advisory groups had presented no real objection to the

Property Approved

7-15-59
channelization design as presented but felt that before this expenditure, estimated
at approximately $13,000.00, was approved, a more detailed study, including cost
		estimates, should be made on the long-range proposal to realign Rancho Road so that

it would cross Charleston Boulevard at right angles a few hundred feet west of the
  present intersection.

The completion of the project as proposed in this manner would bring Rancho Road and
Charleston Boulevard together at a 90° angle which would simplify traffic controls
at this intersection and also eliminate a serious land use and zoning problem.

There are a number of factors which still have to be investigated. The most 
important of these, at least money-wise, is the value of a large home which would have to
be moved to make this project possible.

Mr. Kennedy requested that permission be granted to retain the services of a qualified
local appraiser to appraise the property which would be needed for this realignment
including the home which faces on Charleston Boulevard. With the land costs firmed
up, together with the engineer's estimates of the cost of construction on this piece
of highway, a detailed estimate of the cost could be presented to the Commission.

Commissioner Sharp moved the request of the City Manager be approved.

$lit.,000.00, and the OCDM would pay one-half. This would cover the complete warn-
ing system and the completion of the second floor of the Fire Alaim Building where
the control center would be located.

Mayor Gragson asked if this would lower the insurance rate within the City. Mr.
Kenney stated this would connect the City of Las Vegas with direct outside contact

everything into one central system.

available at this time.

Held in Abeyance

Mr. Kennedy continued that he was of the opinion the City had a sufficient number

tract with the Mercy Ambulance Service and alternate their services every three
months.

City Manager Kennedy advised that in accordance with the present contract with Mercy
Ambulance, the City would be required to give 60 days notice of termination. Com-
missioner Sharp suggested this matter be referred to the City Manager and City
Attorney for recommendation. Commissioner Fountain asked Mr. Curtis about his
insurance and he advised they now had all the insurance available. Mr. Kennedy
stated any change should be made on a 6-month or yearly basis.

SHOW CAUSE HEARING	His Honor Mayor Gragson announced this was the time set for the show cause hearing

Connie Mormon Child	of Connie Mormon in regard to her child nursery licenses.

Nursery Licenses

MR. CORY:	Your Honor and Commissioners, as you will recall at the regular meeting

of the Board of City Commissioners held July 1, 1959; a motion was
unanimously adopted that City Attorney prepare and serve a citation to Connie Mormon
to appear at this time to show cause why her licenses to operate child nurseries
should not be revoked. This action was taken upon the recommendation of a letter
received by the Commission from the Child Welfare Board recommending revocation of
her licenses on the grounds that the said Connie Mormon is an unfit person to be
trusted with the privileges granted by such license for the following reasons:

1.	Failure to properly isolate or remove one or more children from her nursery
upon discovering that said child, or children, had a contagious disease.

2.	Failure to comply with ordinances, rules and regulations of the City of Las
Vegas.

3.	Failure to cooperate with the Child Welfare Board in operation of her nurseries.

Pursuant to motion made on July 1, 1959; a notice to show cause was prepared,
delivered and served on July 2, 1959; a copy of the Child Welfare recommendations and
a copy of the notice to show cause has been furnished to each of the Commissioners.

In addition thereto, there have been furnished to the Commissioners and to Mrs.

Mormon and her attorney, Mr. Galane, copies of affidavits which have been taken in
the office of the City Attorney from witnesses who appeared there on behalf of the
Child Welfare Board to make statements and they are before the Commissioners at this
time.

The Child Welfare Board is here this evening and it is my understanding their chairman 
is present and prepared to make a statement as to the position of the Board and
each member of said Board is also present and prepared to make statements and answer
any questions.

JACK PURSEL: As chairman of the Child Welfare Board, I would like to present to you
the basis on which the recommendation of revocation was made. The
basis of the recommendation is upon complaints, investigations and evidence and 
findings which have been made by the members of the Child Welfare Board who are here
tonight to state specifically the results of their investigations. The five charges
as set forth in the citation on which the Child Welfare Board bases its 
recommendations are as follows:

1.	Failure to properly isolate or remove one or more children from nurseries upon
discovering that said child or children had a contagious disease.

2.	Failure to provide adequate supervision in said child nurseries.

3.	Improper treatment of children while in said nurseries.

4).      Failure to comply with ordinances, rules and regulations of the City of Las
Vegas.

5.       Failure to cooperate with the Child Welfare Board in operation of said nurseries.

I would be pleased to call upon the Child Welfare Nurse and the various members of
the Child Welfare Board.

His Honor Mayor Gragson requested that he do this, and Mr. Pursel called upon
the Child Welfare Nurse, Diane Schnaer, to speak. However, at this point, Mr.

7-22-59
Galane addressed the Commission.

MR. GALANE:	I would like to inquire if I may be permitted to ask questions of

these persons. I received these statements this morning; however,
they were prepared two months ago.

MR. CORY: We are not following procedure as a Court of Law.

MAYOR GRAGSON:	That is right.

MR. GALANE:	I would like to ask you to adopt, as procedure, one of two courses —

either ask questions of those who now make statements so Your Honor and
Commissioners can get as much as possible from them, or direct the question to the
Commission before asking the person. I think that would be fair. I ask a fair opportunity 
to question the witnesses.

MAYOR GRAGSON:	I would ask you to direct the question to the Commission after the

person is through speaking.

COMM. FOUNTAIN:	This is not a court of law and I am not in accord with this procedure.

MAYOR GRAGSON: What is your opinion, Mr. Cory?

MR. CORY:	I am of the opinion it would be proper to direct the question through the

Commission.

MR. GALANE:	At the last meeting the procedure followed was for the former Mayor to

permit the licensee to come forward after the reading of the charges.

If we are departing from this tonight I think it is only fair for the licensee's
counsel to ask questions and establish a fair procedure.

MAYOR GRAGSON:	I would like to poll the Board as to how they wish these questions

to be handled. We do need all of the evidence that we can get.

COMM. WHIPPLE:	The question is whether or not Mr. Galane shall cross-examine the

witnesses directly or state the questions to the Board.

MAYOR GRAGSON:	We would ask that you direct questions to the Board which you wish

to ask the witnesses after they have spoken.

COMM. SHARP:	Does the witness have to answer?

COMM. FOUNTAIN:	I would like to explain to Mr. Galane that I do not see how he

could cross-question an individual unless they would be under oath.

MR. GALANE:	May I suggest that when a particular person has completed his testimony

you permit me to submit the question. The only significance of oath
is if false statement is made under oath, it would be perjury. The truth must come
out if witness will give an honest answer. We are trying to get evidence here. I
discussed this matter with City Attorney before.

COMM. WHIPPLE:	None of these witnesses will be sworn.

MR. GALANE:	I assume they will tell the truth.

MR. CORY:	Ordinance reads:	"At such hearing, or any adjournment thereof, the

licensee may present a reasonable number of witnesses, and such other
evidence may be produced as may be relevant for the consideration of said Board of
Commissioners". Nothing is stated about procedure and conduct of the hearing or
cross-examination. So far as I can ascertain, there is no rule of the Supreme Court
of Nevada as to right of cross-examination at such a hearing. You could adopt a
rule that it is in the power of the Board to preclude or include cross-examination;
and should Mr. Galane wish to question a witness, he could — providing the witness
was willing to answer the question.

MR. GALANE: We depart on only one principle — the right of cross-examination where
a license might be revoked is a constitutional right; therefore, if
this Commission should adopt a rule that cross-examination is not permissible, I
would take exception that it would be unconstitutional.

MAYOR GRAGSON:	What is the pleasure of the Board?

COMM. ELWELL:	I move to permit questions to the Commission.

JACK PURSEL:	I would like it clearly understood that members of the Child Welfare

Board do not fear being questioned in any way whatsoever. The question
here is simply procedure.

MR. CORY:	It would place the Commission in an unfair position to have to determine

whether a witness should or should not answer a question.

MR. GALANE:	I did not say the Commission or myself could make a witness answer. In

order to have evidence I request to be permitted to propound the question —
surely the Commission can control the interrogation. The witness cannot conceal evidence 
and if he refuses to answer, we can draw our own conclusion.

MR. CORY:	What is the difference between going through the Commission or asking the

witness the question directly?

MR. GALANE:	If the question is given to the Commission, then the Commission can see

to it the witness is not harassed and be certain the persons before this
Commission are given fair treatment. I think we are talking this issue to death. If
you deprive the right to question and this license is revoked, I would most certainly
appeal.

COMM. ELWELL:	I move to permit questions to the Commission.

7-22-59
Commissioner Sharp seconded the motion and carried by the following vote:

Commissioners Elwell, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;

Commissioner Fountain voted no, stating that he was a layman and not a lawyer;
that he could not see this precedent set by a City.

MAYOR GRAGSON:	Mr. Pursel, call your witnesses.

JACK PURSEL:	I would like to call on Diane Schnaer, the Child Welfare Nurse.

DIANE SCHNAER:	I was hired by the City of Las Vegas because the citizens of Las Vegas

wanted their children cared for in child nurseries properly protected.

In regard to the case of the child with the chicken pox, Mrs. Mormon said Dr. Ryan

had said it was not necessary to isolate the child, which was an error. Dr. George

examined the child the next day, and stated that she was still contagious. In the	

second case of the child with the mumps, he was not properly isolated. Mrs. Mormon

also failed to keep health records. She was asked for the health record of the

child with chicken pox and she did not have it. Other records that Mrs. Mormon

did have were not complete.

In another instance there appeared to be a child under the age of two years, and
upon a subsequent visit the child was not there, nor had a health record been 
completed. Mrs. Mormon said to me, "Just try and find the mother of this child."

During another visit, children were napping in a room with sun shining in through a	

large window. At my last visit one child was on a cot in the hall. Others were
unable to nap because of commotion in the swimming pool. There is no relaxed
atmosphere. At lunchtime, the children are given no opportunity to ask for a
second sandwich.

When I make visits to Mrs. Mormon's nursery and ask for health records, I am asked
why I don't do this in other nurseries, etc. I have tried to cooperate with Mrs.

Mormon but there was no cooperation with her when I asked her to abide by the rules
and regulations.

MR. GALANE:	My first question:	Is it not true that your husband, using the name of

Al Sherman, works as the representative of Bookie, J. J. Levin in trying 
to place shows in Strip hotels, and that Jack Entratter objected the use permit
when application was made for this nursery?

MR. CORY:	In asking questions regarding testimony of Mrs. Schnaer, I do not think

this is proper cross-examination.

MR. GALANE: We are trying to find out the truth and motives and whether Mrs. Mormon
did or did not cooperate with Mrs. Schnaer or vice-versa. I do not
believe you can object on the grounds that this is not proper questioning. Mrs.

Schnaer just told you Mrs. Mormon would not cooperate; therefore, she has opened the
door. Three weeks after the licensee opened she tried to get other operators to sign
this document and this was two months before the first child had the chicken pox.

On one trip she had Jean Dutton with her. Record shows the protest of Jack Entratter
on the use permit. I present here City Directory and Telephone Directory listing
Al Sherman, 1404. Houssels as theatrical agent and Diane's name is shown also in the
City Directory. I ask Mrs. Schnaer if, on January 21, 1959, she called on Ellie
Adams? And if, on January 22, 1959; Mrs. Schnaer and Mr. Dutton called on Mrs.

Gardner, and if, on January 23, Mrs. Schnaer and another City Official called on
Martha Barber with a typewritten document prepared before they went to these homes?

However, no one signed this document.

JACK PURSEL:	This is a lengthy and complex question. I do not know how the witness

can answer unless the question is broken down.

MR. GALANE:	Was it when the license was granted to Connie Mormon at the present

location on January 5, 1959, that Mrs. Schnaer noted the cooperation of
Connie Mormon changed when she visited her nursery?

DIANE SCHNAER:	After the third week in my position Mrs. Mormon complained about my

aggressiveness. She said it would be a feather in my cap if I
closed the Las Vegas Day Nursery, and that is when we got on a friendly basis.

MR. GALANE:	Then you did not intend to tell this Commission that she became 

uncooperative when she went into the new location?

DIANE SCHNAER:	More so.

MR. GALANE:	Did you take this statement to your licensees?

DIANE SCHNAER: This was a statement of Mrs. Gardner's. In the presence of Jean	*

Dutton she said this was her statement but that she did not prefer
to sign it until she had counsel.

MR. GALANE:	The statement you have there is a copy of the statement shown me by

Sid Sheppard.

DIANE SCHNAER:	This was shown only to Mrs. Gardner — not Mrs. Barber and Mrs.

Adams.

MR. GALANE:	Have you ever at all placed acts at the Fremont Hotel?

DIANE SCHNAER:	At this time I would like to say that my husband would like to do

business for Jack Entratter.

JACK PURSEL:	I am assuming Mrs. Mormon and her operation is on trial tonight and not

Mrs. Schnaer. The regulations under which the Child Welfare Board
operate are by ordinance. It is required that a child with a contagious disease be
removed as soon as possible -- nothing about isolation -- to my knowledge. The
chicken pox case was what the original hearing was about and, subsequently, Mrs.

Mormon was notified as to what this ordinance provided and expected of child nurseries.

A short time thereafter it came to our attention that a child with contagious
mumps was at her nursery. I am simply pointing out to the Board what regulation
directs about keeping a contagious child off the premises.

MSGR. CARMODY:	Your Honor and Members of the Commission:	Going back to the 

question of the communicable disease, Mrs. Mormon agreed to remove any
child from her home that had such a disease and shortly after that the case of mumps
occurred, and feeling is that she was not being as cooperative as she could have
been at that time. The early part of last month on a visit to her home it was a
warm day and about noontime, and children were taking their naps. There was one
youngster in one room not being supervised; another in a hallway which I consider a
fire hazard. In one instance, the nurse asked to see records of the nursery and she
showed us only a portion and not all of the records. These are only instances which
occurred in the last month.



MR. GALANE:	The Child Welfare Ordinance reads as follows:	Any child showing 

symptoms of illness mast be isolated until parents call for him." Here Is
a copy of a memo from Mrs. Schnaer to Jean Dutton dated January 6, 1969, providing
isolation of any child with symptoms of illness. I submit this to the Board.

I have a question to ask Msgr. Carmody and that is whether it is true that on July
13, 1959, the children of owners of the Peter Pan Nursery were permitted to go to a
party with a child having the mumps based on the fact that they had had the illness?
Could they not still be carriers? I want to know which officials approved this and
then find out why Mrs. Mormon could not put a child in an isolation room.

MAYOR GRAGSON:	The decision of the Board is that this question is irrelevant to this

case.

MR. GALANE:	Mr. Pursel told the Commission it is policy of the Child Welfare Board

to remove a child with a contagious disease and I infer from this that
Connie Mormon should be put out of business because she isoHa ted a sick child. Is
it the policy of the Board to remove sick children or does it depend on whom it is?
This is a relevant question as to why she is being discriminated against.

MAYOR GRAGSON:	It is the opinion that this is irrelevant in this specific case. It

is not the Peter Pan license that is before us; it is Connie Mormon's.

JACK PURSEL:	I understand you do not want any response to this question and I would

like to present Mrs. Jean Boman, Member of the Child Welfare Board.

JEAN BOMAN:	Your Honor and Members of the Commission:	I have been on the Child

Welfare Board for a number of years and there are many things you can
put your finger on as you go in and out of homes. I observed many things in Mrs.
Mormon's nursery contrary to others; inadequate adult supervision in her nursery.

I refer to one visit when there was in excess of 20 children and only one housekeeper 
and Mrs. Mormon on duty and they were vacuuming the swimming pool. During
that time there was no supervision. There were two mothers assisting with the
children. Because of the fact this Board has had many complaints against the
nursery we have often observed it without going in. I have seen children playing
in the yard without adult supervision and when we have gone in, it has been inadequately 
supervised. We have also had complaints that the children were inadequately
fed. One time we asked what she served for lunch and was told soup, fruit, cookies,
and sandwiches. When we called at lunchtime, on two different occasions, we found
soup and a small glass of milk, period. This Board feels that is inadequate. At
another time lunch consisted of a cheese sandwich and a glass of milk.

We have had complaints from parents that their children were not treated properly
but were treated in a cross manner, punished by standing in a comer and in a very,
very cross attitude. This is not found in any other nursery we have visited. In
others, it is a happy affair but not so in Mrs. Mormon's nursery. There are many
things impossible to put into words but after experience you can spot instantly the
difference of atmosphere in the nursery.

In regard to contagious diseases, Mrs. Mormon stated:	"If I ever have another case

of any contagious disease I shall immediately remove the child." She tells us she
made an effort to remove the child with the mumps but we feel she did not try very
hard. She kept him almost in a manner of defiance of the rules.

MR. GALANE:	I have 35 signed statements by parents, whose children have been at the

Las Vegas Children's Nursery and if there was no love that is a matter
of opinion. Mrs. Boman might not want to put her children in this nursery -- others
feel there is love in this nursery. This represents a $27,000.00 investment and to
say there is insufficient love does not seem feasible.

JACK PURSEL:	I would like to call on Mrs. Doris Evans.

DORIS EVANS: I am practically new on this Board and it has been work, but it has
been enjoyable. The chief interest is that the children be treated
as near like their mothers would treat them and I am glad to help. I do not believe
that Mrs. .Mormon gave proper supervision. In one instance a child disappeared and
was later found in Hyde Park some distance away. Once when I visited the nursery
with Mrs. Boman I was watching out the window and I noticed one boy throw a baseball
over the fence and he went out of the gate, leaving it open, to get the ball and
brought it back. Mrs. Mormon did not know this even occurred.

MR. GALANE:	I have one question or comment. Here are certified copies of all

minutes of the Child Welfare Board since March 31, 1959. Mrs. Mormon
was in business six years before she moved into this location and had only one
appearance before the Child Welfare Board to get protection for all nurseries on
payment of bills.

JACK .PURSEL:	I think that is all we care to have said by members of the Child

Welfare Board except that I would like to say that I had no intention
of misleading the Commission in any way in stating what the law was. They are quite

7-22-59
lengthy, and I do not have in my hands a copy of them — I believe I could find
the passage I referred to. I want to mention that there are other complaints and
complaining witnesses whose affidavits are in the hands of the City Attorney. I
do not know if any are present here tonight. You have heard from our members the
basis on which our conclusions are made in regard to the operation of the nursery.

m. GALANE:	Are any of the persons here tonight whose affidavits you have?

KAY MCKNIGHT:	I worked for Connie Mormon just this past May and I will tell you

what I saw with my own eyes — standing children in the coiner for
hours and seemingly forgetting about them. Another thing, making a child take
hot pepper in its mouth for doing something wrong; also feeding children peanut
butter sandwiches and allowed no drink until they finished the sandwich.

NELLIE MCCOLLUM:	I worked for Connie Mormon for two weeks and had very distressing

and disturbing experiences. One time she took a little child and
in punishment for some misdemeanor; made her keep hot pepper in her mouth until the
saliva dripped out of her mouth causing red marks down the front of the child. Mrs.
Mormon also placed children in the corner and left them. On one occasion; quite a
young child; not yet three years old; was crying bitterly. I asked what was the
matter and was told she wanted to go out and play in the yard. At that point a
housekeeper took the child and put her in a dark corner. I asked her to let me
talk to her. I told her we were all going out and play in a little while. I had
charge of as high as 21 children in my care at a time — one a Mongoloid child, and
others very young. I saw quite a bit of abuse.

MR. GALANE:	I would like to ask Mrs. McCollum if she was a paid employee.

MRS. MCCOLLUM:	I was paid for one week's work — Mrs. Mormon still owes me for some

time. Yes, I was a paid employee.

MR. GALANE:	Were you discharged for not picking up a child?

MRS. MCCOLLUM:	Mrs. Mormon did not direct me to pick up these children — I had been

in the habit of picking them up but nothing was said. I took my husband 
home and was about 15 or 20 minutes late returning; Mrs. Mormon acted like a
tiger in a cage. She talked abusively and I left her employ. I called her for the
money she owed me but I didn't want to get into a battle over it.

COMM. SHARP: Did you ever hear Connie Mormon swear in the presence of the children?

MRS. MCCOLLUM:	No, she spoke violently; but no swearing.

COMM. SHARP:	Did you see her slap or spank the children?

MRS. MCCOLLUM:	Yes.

COMM. WHIPPLE:	Did this occur frequently?

MRS. MCCOLLUM:	On numerous occasions.

COMM. SHARP:	Do you know whether or not the parents had given Mrs. Mormon this

right to discipline the children in such a manner?

MRS. MCCOLLUM:	Just in one instance is the only one I know of.

MR. GALANE:	In your affidavit you stated you called the Police Department and the

Juvenile Department. Who in the Police Department; and who in the
Juvenile Department did you talk to? And why haven't they been heard from?

MRS. MCCOLLUM:	As far as what I have reported in my statement, it is all true. I

was told by the dispatcher if more children were punished in this
manner these days we wouldn't have juvenile delinquents -- but it still wasn't right.
The dispatcher I talked to sounded like a very illiterate person.

DON DANIELS:	I went to the Doctor's office behind this particular nursery school

and while I waited for the doctor; I watched all of these kids playing
there by themselves -- just little toddlers —on some kind of toy. I watched for
about 25 or 30 minutes and there was nobody else with them. The kids got into a
little argument and a blonde lady came out cursing them and slapping them. I
would not have approved of this if she had been doing this to my kids.

(When Don Daniels was asked who the "blonde lady" was he pointed to Connie
Mormon.)

BARBARA DANIELS:	I work at Prime Meats and Provisions. I go by the nursery on my

way to work. One incident I saw was a dark-skinned girl pick up a
child and drag him by one arm to the back door. It was a wonder she didn't injure
his arm. It aggravated me; there is no excuse to treat children like that.

MR. GALANE:	I would like to request Dr. Carr, Clark County Officer of the Health

Department; be heard as one of our witnesses as he would like to leave

early.

DR. CARR:	Your Honor and City Commissioners:	Late last year we were asked as part

of our duties to check facilities at this location as a possible nursery;
which we did. A permit was issued as it met the code according to our part. That
was the last I heard of this whole situation until sometime about the last of March
when I started off on a scheduled trip to Overton to immunize five or six hundred
migrants for typhoid. A call was received from Mrs. Schnaer about a case of chicken
pox at the Las Vegas Childrens Nursery and was told she could isolate the child in a
private room with a private bath. The next day I called the nursery and was told

7-22-59
there was a case of chicken pox but that Dr. George had just been there and had
said it was no longer contagious. Further, in response to Mr. Kennedy's letter,
on April 3, I made a personal visit to the nursery and verified that Connie Mormon
had the facilities of a room for isolation with a private bath. I saw the youngster
with the chicken pox who was no longer contagious. I learned, to my sorrow, that
Dr. George was not there as a private physician, but as a member of the Child Welfare
Board. I had formerly assumed that Dr. George was the doctor.

But so far as chicken pox is concerned, when you take State regulations and study
them, whether it is chicken pox or mumps, the State Health Department says to isolate
the patient. I gather that the Child Welfare Board regulations vary from this. We
do not close schools because a child has chicken pox or mumps. We just send him home
because it is a well known situation that mumps and chicken pox are not controlled by
any radical quarantine. Epidemic measures have been worthless; therefore, according
to State regulations, the rule is to isolate the patient and let other children go
on to school or to the nursery because you are not going to bring control by closing
the school or nursery.

I realize the Child Welfare Board has the authority to draw up stricter regulations
than the State, and if you think it best for child nurseries, I go along with you to
do it. I think I have talked long enough. We gave the permit for this nursery and
as far as we are concerned she has the isolation room -- the chicken pox and mumps
was reported from the nursery. I might mention that I wrote to the Assistant State
Health Officer; he said to let them go ahead and have them before they get into
adolescence, as long as they are not too young.

JACK PURSEL:	Dr. George could not be here tonight, so I will state what he reported

to the Board. "I did not tell Mrs. Mormon the child was not contagious
but told her the child should be removed immediately". In regard to the Child Welfare
Board regulations — they are not our regulations — they have been prepared and adopted
by the City as	have all the	other ordinances. We have a group	of people serving	on

the Child Welfare Board who	serve in this capacity without pay	and are trying	to	follow

the ordinances as intended.

-0O0-

At the hour of 8:30 p.m. the meeting was recessed and reconvened at the hour
of 8:45 p.m. with all members present as of the opening session.

-0O0-

MR. GALANE:	I	want to call	Mr. Sid Sheppard as a witness.

MR. SHEPPARD:	I would like	to make a statement and the reason	I am making it	is	that

I was asked by the nursery association to help them out a few months
ago. I got interested in the Child Welfare Board and offered my services. I work
with the Variety Nursery and I have seen quite a bit going on by observation. I
became so interested I asked two City Employees out to lunch. One was Jean Dutton
and the other was the Child Welfare Nurse, Diane Schnaer. I would like to know myself 
why they made such statements and said to me they would deny them if they were
ever brought up. No cooperation from Mrs. Schnaer whatsoever; she seemed to have
personal grievances against Mrs. Mormon. Mrs. Mormon has a fine nursery and she is
willing to cooperate. Why can't we have slips issued so if there is a complaint
this slip would be made out and given to the operator, and then if not complied
with, take action.

COMM. SHARP:	Do you have any interest in this nursery?

MR. SHEPPARD:	I did furnish the nursery with furniture. Sister Charles said no

one in town could get equipment for the nursery, and this I did. We
were paid for our services. I also attended a meeting of the Child Nurseries
Association. Every one of them asked me to help them get along with the Child
Welfare Nurse. I brought out at another Commission meeting that the nursery operators 
had made the statement to me that they were in fear of this Child Welfare Nurse.

MAYOR GRAGSON: Would you want to state what the comment was that would be denied?

MR. SHEPPARD:	I would like to ask if this question could be asked to Mr. Dutton and

Mrs. Schnaer if they made the statement that they would deny anything
they had said at this luncheon. One statement impressed me and that was that it was
personality that Mrs. Schnaer did not care for in regard to Mrs. Mormon. Of course,
this would have to be substantiated by Mrs. Schnaer.

COMM. FOUNTAIN: What was said by Mr. Dutton?

MR. SHEPPARD:	I was trying to get cooperation from the License Bureau, Child Welfare

Nurse, and members of the Board to get together to see if something
could not be worked out with Connie Mormon. Mr. Dutton, in any statements he made,
went along with the thinking of the Board. Why he would deny anything he said is a
matter of just strictly conversation; he hadn't said anything detrimental himself.

COMM. WHIPPLE:	I do not see that this is of any consequence.

MR. SHEPPARD:	When you are sitting around and making conversation and find the 

person personally does not like Connie Mormon, it is bringing out why so
many complaints have been brought forth by Mrs. Schnaer. From the complaints put in
to this Board, I feel there is a persecution from her attitude. It is the same as
saying that justice is done and she doesn't like her and is going to see that it is
getting done.

COMM. SHARP:	Are you saying we bullied these people to make these statements because

she does not like Connie Mormon?

MR. SHEPPARD:	I said that she doesn't like Connie Mormon as a nursery operator.

COMM. WHIPPLE: What about the other members of the Child Welfare Board?

7-22-59
COMM. FOUNTAIN:	All made statements regarding Mrs. Mormon's operation of her

nursery.

MR. GALANE:	May I suggest the Child Welfare Board has been trying to promulgate

stricter law for operation of nurseries. This Board is trying to do
a good job but is so frustrated that when opportunity is given them to make an
example of somebody by the nurse, they become aroused. If this Commission would
take ordinance out of committee it would substantiate what they are trying to do.

COMM. WHIPPLE:	Do you mean that the people on the Child Welfare Board are confused?

MR. GALANE:	They want stricter standards. She would go out to mothers to get 

statements. She has been out all over town. She called Mr. Ayoub at the
Fremont Hotel. I say the Child Welfare Nurse has aroused the Child Welfare Board
and the real problem is to get the new ordinance to cover the standards.

COMM. WHIPPLE:	Do you believe they are people that could be frustrated? As to

the Child Welfare Ordinance Amendment, this was referred to 
                                  committee only a few meetings ago and there are a few minor changes to be made.

MR. GALANE:	That is an impression I did not intentionally want to bring about. If

the problem is the need for stricter standards to be set forth, there
is no reason for the Child Welfare Nurse to harass one operator. Every time you
pick up a newspaper in the City of Las Vegas you read about Connie Mormon's nursery.
You would not put a child in this nursery. I read charges dismissed — charges
renewed! Mrs. Mormon made the biggest investment of this type in this City when
she had the courage to invest $27,000.00.

COMM. WHIPPLE:	There is a big difference between money and the taking care of and

training of children.

MR. GALANE:	We have mothers here who do have their children there. You are going

to put her out of business without ever revoking her license.

COMM. WHIPPLE:	We are not responsible for everything published in the newspaper.

MR. GALANE:	Every time charges were published in the newspaper it wasn't humorous

to Mrs. Mormon. It has been the destruction of her business.

COMM. WHIPPLE:	Were you inferring that the Child Welfare Board members were 

confused and frustrated?

MR. GALANE: When a Board desires stricter regulations for the entire industry and
cannot see it adopted, it is in a sense, frustrated.

MRS. MELVIN MOSS:	I am a new member of the Child Welfare Board so I cannot make

any statement. However, Mr. Galane is not in any position to
make a statement about my frustration. I mean to do my job and take care of the
children the best way we can find. Regulations are subject to change every day
all over the land. In arbitrary thinking you dig out of your records.

JACK PURSEL:	I don't think it is a question of "I like you" or "I don't like you".

I have been a member of the Board for six years and every member is
an independent thinker, and tries to do their job. The question is what has Mrs.
Mormon done, and is it in violation of an ordinance? Mrs. Schnaer or the Child
Welfare Board is not on trial.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN:	Just before this meeting was recessed it was stated that Mrs.

Mormon was told to isolate the child. Before that it was
stated there was not enough help to take care of the children outside, so who saw
that the child was kept in isolation, and was it brought back and forth at night?

ROBERT FOLKER:	It was my child who had the mumps. Speaking of hospitals, the

statement was made that he should have been put in a hospital.

There is not a hospital in the country that is willing to admit a child with a
contagious disease. He was happy there and attended to immediately if he needed
something.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN:	If the child could not be admitted to a hospital, why keep

him in a nursery?

MR. GALANE:	Did your child have mumps when you brought him into the nursery?

ROBERT FOLKER:	He was not ill to my knowledge when he was brought to the nursery.

I was notified the following day that Mrs. Mormon had noticed
swelling and he was checked by my doctor, who found the child had mumps.

COMM. WHIPPLE: How long was the child in the nursery when he showed signs of the
 mumps?

ROBERT FOLKER:	Twenty-four hours.

COMM. WHIPPLE:	Did you take him home?

ROBERT FOLKER:	The child's home is the nursery. After taking him to the doctor

he was brought back to the nursery and isolated. I am working
part time for the Mercy Ambulance and I got face masks for anybody entering or
exiting the room which was used by myself and whoever entered the room. He was
isolated in the room for approximately 7 to 10 days.

MR. GALANE:	Did you try to have the child removed from the nursery or did Mrs.

Mormon make an effort to have the child removed from the nursery, and
with what results?

ROBERT FOLKER:	We both tried. I called many friends who have families of their own

7-22-59
and either one of their children hadn't had the mumps yet, or there were other
children staying with them who hadn't had the mumps, or else there was an 
expectant mother in the home.

MR. GALANE:	Does the child have a mother?

ROBERT FOLKER:	No, sir.

MR. GALANE:	Did the grandmother know where you were working?

ROBERT FOLKER:	She was not even home when I took Eddie.

COMM. WHIPPLE:	The child had mumps in the nursery and was left there with the full

knowledge that he had the mumps and could expose other children.
After the experience of the child who had chicken pox, Connie promised if another
situation like that arose she would immediately get the child removed, that is, if
there was another child with a contagious disease.

MR. GALANE:	The child was brought there without the disease and became ill. Dr.

LaCanna instructed them to isolate him and the child was isolated.
Effort was made to place the child elsewhere. If you are going to be fair how can
you hold Mrs. Mormon responsible? Which would be the worse crime — setting him
out in the street, or isolating him as she did? I think if Connie Mormon had put
that child out after that child became ill in that home she would have been liable
for damages. Having voluntarily gone into business to take care of children, the
father could have sued her and he would have had a case.

COMM. SHARP:	How long after the child was admitted was it discovered that he had

the mumps?

MR. GALANE:	Twenty-four hours.

MR. CORY:	Did you advise Connie Mormon to remove this child?

MR. GALANE:	I advised her to try to remove the child, and to contact Dr. LaCanna

to get his advice.

MR. CORY:	Would you agree that the testimony of Dr. Carr was to the facilities of

the room?

MR. GALANE:	No. Dr. Carr said he conferred with Dr. LaCanna and that he approved

the facility, and Dr. LaCanna instructed the child be bedded down. You
cannot say we did not try to find a place for the child.

MSGR. CARMODY:	On this particular day in question I know of five adults, whom I

saw with my own eyes, who went in there and talked to this child to
the extent of shaking hands or gestures. We were not asked to put the mask on or
disinfect ourselves. Criticize if you will; we did not think of it ourselves.

But as an operator she should have told us to get out. What I have said is my own
opinion. I am not dominated by Mrs. Schnaer.

MR. GALANE:	You charge Mrs. Mormon of being uncooperative and walk in with the open

objective of closing her up. It is understandable that Mrs. Mormon
had no choice. You charge her with uncooperation and now ask why she didn't throw
them out when five of them walked into the room with no protection. If she had
thrown them out what would have happened?

DORIS EVANS:	Mrs. Mormon had a mask around her neck, not over her nose or mouth.

Dr. George was with us and we felt there was nothing wrong going in.
Had she said not to we wouldn't have. Dr. George told us a hospital will take a
child with a contagious disease if there is nowhere else to put the child.

JEAN BOMAN: We felt that if there had been a spirit of cooperation the first thing
she should have done was to call a member of the Child Welfare Board
and ask what she should do, and we would have contacted Dr. George and put the child
in a hospital. Mr. Folker and Mrs. Mormon were not using a mask nor the pans of
disinfectant that were there. At the time of the chicken pox there was another
child running in and out of the room. The way the room is set up it would be
impossible to keep other children out.

COMM. WHIPPLE: When this boy came down with the mumps did Connie Mormon call any
Board member or the Child Welfare Nurse to ask for help?

JEAN BOMAN:	No, she did not. We asked her and she said she had consulted her

attorney. It was at a Child Welfare Board meeting the Tuesday after
the child had been put in the nursery on Friday when someone told us there was a
case of mumps at Mrs. Mormon's nursery. It was after this meeting that the Board
visited the nursery.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN:	Dr. George was present at that time; did he wear a mask or use

the disinfectant?

CONNIE MORMON:	I didn't believe I was in a position to tell a doctor and nurse

what to do. The hospital gown and several masks were available.

They asked to see the sick child and walked on in. Am I in a position to tell two
professional people what is proper? I have never said anything when they came in
and out. Yes, I am guilty of taking care of a little boy the hospital would not
take. Dr. Carr and Dr. LaCanna approved the isolation room in which I took care
of this child. No, I did not contact the Board. I was never told or asked to
contact the Board. I went to Dr. Carr. Dr. George said I am wrong to go to the
Head of the Department. It is my misfortune this boy came to my nursery.

COMM. WHIPPLE: Why did you not contact the Child Welfare Board when you found out
the boy had mumps after you promised you would? You say you didn't
know at the time the child had the mumps, but when you did find out, why didn't you

7-22-59
call the Board?

CONNIE MORMON:	I never went through this procedure before.

COMM. WHIPPLE:	You had made a promise when you had previous trouble. Don't you

feel there should be cooperation between you and the Child Welfare

Board?

CONNIE MORMON:	I didn't think. I was befuddled. It was Helldorado weekend and

I was very busy at the nursery.

MAYOR GRAGSON:	When did you call Dr. Carr?

CONNIE MORMON:	It was Monday morning before Dr. LaCanna was able to reach Dr.

Carr.

MAYOR., GRAGSON:	What day was Dr. LaCanna there?

CONNIE MORMON:	The doctor was there the day he came down with the mumps.

MAYOR GRAGSON:	How long after the boy was admitted did you realize he had the mumps?

CONNIE MORMON:	The day after he was admitted. I believe he was admitted on May 14th

and then took sick on the 15th. I had gone to Morton Galane's office
and received a call while I was there and found out the child had the mumps. Dr.
LaCanna came but couldn't reach Dr. Carr until Monday.

COMM. WHIPPLE:	You say you tried hard to cooperate with the Child Welfare Board.

Don't you think this would have been an excellent opportunity to
call them and tell them of your problem?

CONNIE MORMON:	You are right.

JACK PURSEL:	The physical make-up of the isolation room is that it is a bedroom

with two bunk beds. When we visited there the Tuesday following this
child's admittance this child was on top of one of the bunk beds. I question the
isolation as it seems to be the only bedroom on the premises.

CONNIE MORMON:	The isolation room has four beds. A sick child is placed there

until its mother can come and take it. Then the room is properly
aired and cleaned. I asked Dr. LaCanna where I could bed them down; they were
bedded down on my cots, which are the finest cots I can buy. What was I to do?

MR. GALANE:	Is this license conditioned on this very room?

JACK PURSEL:	As a bedroom.

DIANE SCHNAER:	Before I came here as a nurse, sometime in the past the records

show that Mrs. Mormon did appear before the Child Welfare Board.

The problem then was how to get money from mothers so she could get paid. She
could have come to the Board when this child came down with the mumps. The
Juvenile Home would have taken this child. If she had called me, I would have
called the Juvenile Home to take him with the contagious disease.

MR. GALANE:	The father had not deserted the child. What about the Brodsky child

from the Peter Pan Nursery with the mumps? Who gave permission for

this?

DIANE SCHNAER:	I was not aware they had any mumps at the Peter Pan Nursery.

DON DANIELS:	I believe there are qualified people on the Child Welfare Board and

what they have observed each time in visiting this nursery, all in
accordance, that this is not fit to remain a nursery school. They must have real
good reasons to feel her license should be revoked.

MAYOR GRAGSON:	This Board is only interested in evidence and not opinions. Do you

have any more witnesses, Mr. Galane?

MR. GALANE:	Mrs. Mormon would like to make a statement in her own words and in

response to some of the charges. Her interests are at stake.

CONNIE MORMON:	Domestic help	is	very difficult	in this	town. Most of	them	are	not

dependable so	we	try to get the	best we	can. I	am not	with	my

employees at all times. If there are complaints and a woman sees a child being
dragged, why don't they tell me? If they knew, why not call a meeting and discuss
it? The other nurse would discuss it with us. I get a citation or read it in the
paper before I know about it. I am not entirely guilty. If I am, then every nursery
in this town is guilty of something. I wouldn't be stupid enough to jeopardize my
fine home and investment. I am trying to do my best. The Board comes in. They
walk in, they walk out. They ask for my records, look at them, and walk out. If
the food is inadequate why don't they stay to see how the children like it? Mr.
Sheppard said I am equipped to take in children with disease. I take good care of
my children. How can I cooperate if I don't know what to do? I have problems with
tourists children. I have problems in my big nursery that we have never had before.
We need help and can only get	this by working together,	not one	against the	other.

This is true.	I don't know what	else I can say	to this	Board.

MAYOR GRAGSON: What do you have to say as to your methods of punishment, the red
pepper and so on?

CONNIE MORMON: This method has only been used four, or say six, times. I have used
it when I have had a bad biter and have taken a pinch of chili pepper
to put in the child's mouth. This is no different than "Thum" from the drug store.

The mother is told of this when she comes after the child. If the mother does not
want her child punished, they tell me. Every child is different. Some are very good,

7-22-59
some are very bad. There is no law that says I cannot do it with the parents 
permission. I have been in business six years and if there were any complaints there
would have been some a long time ago. This town is growing, growing fast. We have
nurseries and room for more nurseries, and we must have help of people with experience.
There are conflicting opinions and I am in the middle. All nurseries are in fear of
what is happening to me. We never had this problem before. What is happening now?
Every nursery operator in town needs your help. We can only get it by the Child
Welfare Board helping us. This town is a 24-hour town and there is not another like
it anywhere else.

MRS. RAWLEY:	My son has been kept by Connie. About love, what mother doesn't 

reprimand her children? I do not think there is anything wrong with that
punishment. He gets worse than that at home. Mrs. Mormon teaches my son good manners.
Keeping children in sight at all times is almost an impossibility. I think Connie is
a pretty good kid. If my child got the mumps and Connie called me and then moved him
before I could get him, I would be plenty mad. If Grady stayed there 24 hours I
wouldn't want him to be sent to the Juvenile Home. I could sue her, as stated before,
if she put my son in a home.

MSGR. CARMODY:	In summation and in answer to Mrs. Mormon's statement that the Board

was unwilling to cooperate and give suggestions and so on, I offered
suggestions on occasion and was promptly put into my place. She told me it was none
of my business, so I cannot cooperate. In case that anyone feels that Mrs. Mormon
is an isolated instance, she is not. It became necessary for us to recommend revocation 
or suspension of another license. The operator was cited and cooperated
with us. It is now all okay. The same regulations are given to all nurseries. I
have gone to nurseries at odd hours, unannounced, and have never been challenged or
denied any questions I asked. If a person is hired to take care of a child, that
person has a greater responsibility than the parent has. More care and diligence
should be shown. Another point:	I do not feel that any member of the Board wishes

to put any nursery out of business; just ask these operators to come up to the standard 
of the City. If they fail to do this after recommendations from us, recommendation 
is made to the City Commission. We feel that Mrs. Mormon has failed on numerous
 occasions, after requests by us, to come up to standards set up for the City.

MR. GALANE:	I would like to call Lillian Kaercher as a witness.

LILLIAN KAERCHER:	During the time I was Child Welfare Nurse, Connie operated only

one nursery. I have no official knowledge of her present nursery.
Happy House was licensed when I came to work for the City and we had no serious
trouble. At that time the license was for nine children. There were never more than
eight at one time. We had some differences and usually discussed them. Connie called
me if something came up a little out of the ordinary.

MR. GALANE:	Did you voluntarily resign from the position of Child Welfare Officer?

LILLIAN KAERCHER:	Yes, on September 15, 1958.

MR. GALANE: Who was your replacement?

LILLIAN KAERCHER:	Mrs. Diane Schnaer.

MR. GALANE:	Did Connie Mormon ever have citations previous to this?

LILLIAN KAERCHER:	Not to my knowledge.

MR. CORY:	Do you have any present knowledge of the new nursery?

LILLIAN KAERCHER:	No official knowledge. I have been there.

MR. GALANE: .Do you know of a case recently thrown out of North Las Vegas who was
recently licensed in Las Vegas:

LILLIAN KAERCHER:	I know of one; Mrs. Flo Hansen.

JEAN BOMAN:	This license has not been delivered.

MR. GALANE:	She is advertising.

MR. CORY:	Anyone can advertise without anybody's permission.

MAYOR GRAGSON:	Frankly, I can't see the bearing that that has on this case.

MR. GALANE:	I think the case takes on more than Connie Mormon's license. Mrs.

Mormon has the finest plant in the community. The City licenses
questionable people. Mrs. Kaercher had no trouble with Connie Mormon.

COMM. SHARP:	I wish to correct your statement. The license is in process.

COMM. WHIPPLE:	What is the connection with the Flo Hansen application?

MR. GALANE:	Another nursery never met Health Department requirements. Mrs. Mormon

reported this.

CONNIE MORMON:	Two members of the nursery association went to see Jack Pursel in

regard to the nursery at 310 North 9th Street, and asked if they
knew this operator opened without running water and did not meet the requirements.

Jack Pursel said he would check into it. I called him in a few days and asked him
if he had gone down to Mrs. Magleby's. He suggested that I attend to my own plant
or it might be difficult for me. Mrs. Atchley called Otto MacFarland and asked if
Mrs. Magleby passed fire inspection with fence and oil barrels. He stated that
Mrs. Magleby was going to be all right, and to tell Connie Mormon for him that her
building was much newer that Connie Mormon's, and he would not stop until he found
something wrong with my place. This statement was made to Florine Atchley. We put
this association together when Mrs. Kaercher left. We had a party for Mrs. Kaercher,

7-22-59
and also to say hello to	Mrs. Schnaer. We paid $107.00	for	a gift of a pair

of lamps, which she	justly deserved — she, who had sat	down and observed our

children. Diane Schnaer refused to have a cup of coffee on her visit. We could
expect no intimacy. She gossips very badly. Too much food; not motherly. I
told Diane she might work out. We expected changes but not a complete shake-down.

She told other nurseries if they stayed with me they would be in trouble.

COMM. FOUNTAIN:	I understood Msgr. Carmody to say he asked you questions and you

told him it was none of his business.

CONNIE MORMON:	I did not make this statement.

COMM. SHARP:	What do you mean by shake down?

CONNIE MORMON:	You	have	a new person taking over and a	new	person with ideas	of

her	own.	We expected a few changes but	not	all this woman would

recommend. If the nurse would tell us what is wrong you would never have any trouble.
I tried to be friendly.

COMM. SHARP:	Is Mrs. Atchley here?

CONNIE MORMON:	She had an accident and is under sedation.

MR. GALANE:	We can secure an affidavit from Mrs. Atchley, and I would be glad to

submit this affidavit corroborating her statement.

JACK PURSEL:	Are there any more witnesses?

MR. GALANE:	I would like to request one more witness. Laura Smith.

LAURA SMITH:	I had a conversation with Diane Schnaer the middle of May. I went to

the Child Welfare Nurse concerning operation of schools here, and asked
her if any place might be available here. I had a school in Texas. She told me that
Bo-Peep might be interested in selling. I was told by her that one operator was on
probation at this time. She said, "If her license is	not revoked we plan to ask	her

to resign." She also told	me that she was infringing	on Mrs. Magleby's name.	I

went to Connie Mormon's nursery and observed her lovely place, and stopped to tell
her we might be interested	in buying her place if her	license was revoked. I	talked

with two other operators.	Peter Pan invited me over,	but I did not have time	to	 go

there.

COMM. WHIPPLE:	Did you visit Connie Mormon on Charleston?

LAURA SMITH:	Yes, and on several occasions for three or four hours, long enough to

observe her method of operation.

MR. GALANE:	Were you there when the child had the mumps?

LAURA SMITH:	Yes, the child's neck was swollen. The doctor was called and he was

busy, so the child was carried to the doctor's office.

MR. KENNEDY:	I would like to say for the record that Mrs. Schnaer was told by her

boss, Mr. Jean Dutton, not to sit around drinking coffee; that was not

her job.

LAURA SMITH:	At the time I was in Mrs. Schnaer's office she stated they did not

want this to come to trial at that time; they would rather wait for it
to come to trial after the election.

DIANE SCHNAER:	I would have been very foolish to have made such a statement. No, I

did not make this statement.

LAURA SMITH:	She did make the statement.

MR. GALANE: As reluctant as I am, this is all the witnesses, as it is getting late.

Mrs. Mormon has spoken better than an attorney. We would ask one thing.
We do not want probation; we want dismissal of the charges. If you put this license
on probation we will ask for review. We ask for dismissal of charges. As far as
the nurse is concerned that is up to you. We wish a finality on this matter.

At the hour of 11:10 p.m. the meeting was recessed and reconvened at the hour

Commissioner Sharp moved this meeting be recessed to 4:00 p.m. tomorrow 
afternoon, Thursday, July 23, 1959, in the Council Chamber of the City Hall.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting
aye; noes, none.

-oOo-

This meeting was reconvened at the hour of 4:00 p.m., Thursday, July 23, 1959
in the Council Chambers of the City Hall with all members present as of the
opening session.

MAYOR GRAGSON:	I will call the meeting to order for the continuation of the special

meeting held last night and recessed to this time. We will continue
with the Show Cause Hearing of Connie Mormon and why her licenses to operate two
nurseries should not be revoked. I believe you had something to say, Mr. Galane.

MR. GALANE:	Yes, I did, and I wish to thank you for this opportunity. I have a brief

7-22-59 and 7-23-59
statement for your consideration at this time. Today I made an inquiry of the City
Clerk as to the availability of last night's minutes and was told that they were not
completed. If this is true it would be illegal to make a decision today. The 
constitution requires that the council consider the whole record. Secondly, I wish to
point out that I learned today that a City Official, using the official stationery
of the City of Las Vegas, sent out letters to citizens of Las Vegas ordering them
to appear as witnesses at the hearing. If that is true, it means that the proponents 
of the show cause order have used official stationery to give people the
impression that they are ordered to appear at a hearing while the licensee has no
power or no way of subpoenaing witnesses. This is undue process of the law. My
next point: Commissioner Whipple stated at the hearing last night that Connie
Mormon promised to have any child with a contagious disease removed from her 
nursery when she was cited at the earlier hearing. I have examined certified copies
of the minutes. There is no such promise in the minutes; therefore, any decision
of the City Council predicated upon the consideration of that statement would be
illegal.

MR. CORY:	Do you deny that Connie Mormon made such a statement?

MR. GALANE:	I do not know. I believe this hearing is based on incompetent 

evidence. This Commission took no verbatim minutes nor a transcription.

 This is not what we call a transcribed hearing where a witness is quoted verbatim.
Such a method would be illegal and unconstitutional. No findings or conclusions have
been proposed so the licensee can argue the reasoning of the City Commission. This
violates the due course of law. The meeting was adjourned at a late hour last night
and there was no opportunity to argue whatever evidence was submitted. The next
point we learned from the City Clerk this afternoon was that the clerk had taken
the exhibits we presented last night to the conference room.

CITY CLERK:	I told you the exhibits were taken to the City Attorney's office.

MR. GALANE:	Were they considered at the meeting today?

MAYOR GRAGSON:	Commissioner Sharp and Commissioner Fountain arrived at the last

minute. The meeting before had nothing to do with the exhibits.

MR. GALANE:	As of last night no decision was reached. If it has been discussed

it would be an illegal procedure.

COMM. FOUNTAIN:	I attended no conference today in any way in connection with

Connie Mormon's case.

MR. GALANE:	Thank you, Commissioner. And since no decision was reached last

night, then a decision has been reached sometime since last night.

MAYOR GRAGSON:	I don't know as a decision has been made.

MR. GALANE:	If any decision has been reached or any conference or conferences have

been held today by members of this Commission concerning this hearing
and not with all persons present, it would be illegal. The law requires those who
hear evidence must all confer. Was the City Attorney present in conference room
during the deliberations?

COMM. WHIPPLE:	What deliberations? We met last night and now here today. If

there were any deliberations, I have no knowledge of them.

MR. CORY:	My presence last night was required only to present the status of this

matter.

MR. GALANE:	Since the City Attorney is counsel for the City in regard to this Show

Cause Hearing and I am counsel for Connie Mormon, it is not lawful for
any conferences without the presence of the attorney of the licensee.

MR. CORY:	Are you serious about that?

MR. GALANE:	Yes, Mr. Cory. Commissioner Sharp stated at the meeting three weeks

ago when Show Cause was issued, that Mrs. Mormon and counsel should
be apprised of all the facts as soon as possible. That is not revealed in the
minutes. When Commissioners looked at the calendar and decided on the hearing
date, Commissioner Sharp stated record should show these were to be immediately
sent to Mrs. Mormon and counsel. These were not received until yesterday morning.

MR. CORY:	Record, does not show that. The attorney was instructed to immediately

furnish the citation and that was delivered on July 2, 1959, the follow-
ing day. If you are referring to affidavits, these were not included in the speci-
fication of charges.

MR. GALANE:	I will make two additional statements. This was not a true 

specification of the charges. Under Ordinance No. 588 specific facts are to
be set forth and these merely specified general violation of rules and regulations,
not which, ones and on what dates. There was no explanation of improper treatment
of children; no list of witnesses in advance of the hearing. In fairness we should
have been apprised of these and I believe that was the intention of the Commission
at that time. At last night's hearing laymen were repeatedly permitted to express
medical opinions as to medical matters. They were unqualified to say what they did.
It should be stricken from the record and cannot be considered in the revocation of
this license.

MR. CORY:	You called Mrs. Smith as a witness. Is she a layman?

MR. GALANE:	Yes.

MR. CORY: Would you believe her layman evidence? You also called Mrs. Rawley, a
mother, who spoke as a layman.

MR. GALANE:	She volunteered.

7-23-59
MR. CORY:	You accepted her statement as evidence.

MR. GALANE:	Only to the extent of any witnesses for the licensee or the City.

MR. CORY:	Do you reject these?

MR. GALANE:	I don't remember medical opinions stated.

MR. CORY:	She believed children should be spanked.

MR. GALANE:	This is not a medical statement.

MR. CORY:	Do you acknowledge she is a layman?

MR. GALANE:	Yes. I must present these points if we are to proceed in an orderly

fashion. Dr. Carr was the only medical expert to answer. Dr. George
of the Child Welfare Board didn't show up. We have only Dr. Carr's testimony to
rely on. In regard to medical opinions expressed by any member of the Child Welfare
Board or the nurse, who is not a doctor, that evidence should be stricken, My next
point:	We were very severely prejudiced when, in the midst of our case, Msgr.

Carmody said he was going to make a summation. I think there was an error on the
part of the City Commission to permit such an interruption of our presentation. We
did not interfere in such a manner.

MR. CORY:	You had the opportunity to cross-examine each member of the Board.

MR. GALANE:	So the record can be kept straight, I wish it stated that the ruling

permitted us to propose question to the Board first to see if it would
be allowed, subject to the condition that the witness could not be ordered or 
compelled to answer.

MR. CORY:	Did you agree with this ruling?

MR. GALANE:	This is not the right of cross-examination, but I agreed with the ruling.

If I interrupted to propose a question to the Board, that is not an
interruption. Nevertheless, a witness from the Child Welfare Board was allowed to
interrupt and make a summation; an error was committed.

MR. CORY:	Did you not have the same opportunity to ask questions of any witnesses

for the Child Welfare Board?

MR. GALANE: I did not have, on behalf of Mrs. Mormon, the right to cross-examine.

MR. CORY: Did you not have the same right as the Board?

MR. GALANE: Witness for the Board interrupted our presentation and nobody stopped
him. We were denied our rights under the 14th Amendment of the

Constitution.

MAYOR GRAGSON:	In order to make the record clear, Msgr. Carmody got up when I

asked if you had any other witnesses. You did not hear me. Then
after that you got up and told us you had another witness.

MR. GALANE:	My recollection was, if we get good minutes, it was on another occasion

that I did not hear you, and at that time I had no chance. It is very
improper from a legal viewpoint.

COMM. WHIPPLE:	Mrs. Mormon said that she would cooperate with the Child Welfare

Board if a similar case happened in her nursery again. I would like
this shown on the record.

MR. GALANE:	I think a member of the Board stated Mrs. Mormon made this promise,

but I cannot find it in the minutes.

COMM. WHIPPLE:	I think the issue is clear if you read the minutes. I would like

to ask the question whether or not we are obligated to act as a
court of law and act on technicalities listed or on the intent.

MR. CORY:	This is an Administrative Board whose purpose is to determine the facts

and make a decision. I think Mr. Galane will go along that you are not
bound by court rules of evidence. You can receive in evidence hearsay testimony.
However, you may not base your decision entirely on hearsay. If there is substantial
evidence to support your conclusion, you will then be justified in making that 
determination.

MR. GALANE: Would the Commission permit a brief reply to the City Attorney:

MAYOR GRAGSON:	Go ahead.

MR. GALANE:	I disagree with Cal. When the procedure is of a disciplinary nature,

the burden of proof is on the City. It must be shown on what the 
ruling was based. Secondly, we do have the right of cross-examination where testimony
is involved. Third, the acceptability of improper evidence would clearly invalidate
the legality of the ruling. When you are going to revoke a license you should have
the basic requirements of due process of the law. If not, we would go to the 14th
Amendment. (At this point, Mr. Galane also went into an explanation regarding
hearsay evidence and referred to one of the Senators of the State of Nevada, who
was author of this act.)

MR. CORY:	Are you suggesting you were denied, at any time last night, the right of

cross-examination of any witnesses, including your own?

MR. GALANE:	I was denied the right of cross-examination. That was not cross-examination.



MR. CORY:	Are you now asserting that you were denied a fair opportunity to present

7-23-59
your case and all the evidence that you had?

MR. GALANE: If denied the due process of the law, I will hold by the 14th 
Amendment, and the answer is yes. There is no transcription, no minutes.

MR. CORY:	At any time last night did the Commission refuse to hear any evidence

that you had to offer?

MR. GALANE:	To the extent that we were denied due process of the law. The 

Commission did not hear a complete record.

MR. CORY:	Did you offer any evidence the Commission refused?

MR. GALANE:	Yes, in regard to the Peter Pan Nursery given permission to permit

communication of contagious disease at the time Connie Mormon was
being cited and Mrs. Schnaer denied knowledge of this. I asked who permitted this
and received no answer.

MR. CORY: Would you say this was also hearsay?

MR. GALANE:	The Welfare Board made this omission and the Commission should have

asked. It would be hearsay. The Commission rejected the newspaper
item and the Mayor said it was not relevant.

MR. CORY:	Do you base your argument on this Peter Pan incident?

MR. GALANE:	We can base our case on any error that can be supported under judicial

review.

MR. CORY:	You have made assertions the Commission has denied the right of 

crossexamination and I make the assertion that they did not deny you the right
of cross-examination. You have been allowed the largest possible latitude.

MR. GALANE:	The initial ruling was that any questions I proposed would have to be

ruled upon at the bench. This is not cross-examination. I disagree
with you. I respect your opinions and in a great many areas your opinions are
preferable to my own. However, in this instance, I feel the right of cross-examination
was denied.

MR. CORY:	I have nothing further.

Commissioner Sharp moved that on the basis of evidence presented, the child
nursery licenses of Connie Mormon be revoked.

Motion was seconded by Commissioner Fountain and the vote was as follows:	

Commissioners Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
Commissioner Elwell voting no.

City Attorney Calvin Cory stated the motion was not carried because of the one
"no" vote, as under City Ordinance a unanimous vote is required for the 
revocation of a license.

Mayor Gragson stated he would entertain a motion that the order to Show Cause be
dismissed upon the advice of the City Attorney that final action should be taken
to clear the record.

Commissioner Fountain moved the order to Show Cause be dismissed as stated by
the City Attorney that for revocation of a license a unanimous vote of the Board
is required.

JEAN BOMAN:	I would like to ask a question, if I am not out of order. What purpose

does the Child Welfare Board serve if their recommendations are not
listened to by the Commissioners? What reason is there for our existence?

MAYOR GRAGSON:	I would like to ask the City Attorney to answer your question.

MR. CORY:	I would like to answer your question by reference to all Boards. As I

understand it, and you must realize I am a neophyte in this position, the
City Commission many years ago determined it must function with the advice of other
citizens. In other words, the Commissioners themselves do not have the time nor the
opportunity to investigate various violations of ordinances or investigate prospective
applications. Consequently, the City Commission adopted ordinances empowering the
creation of Boards. The Child Welfare Board is one of these Boards as is the Planning
Commission, the Board of Zoning Adjustment, and the Board of Civil Service Trustees,
to mention a few. The purpose of these Boards is to advise the City Commission the
actions which that particular Board is given the authority to investigate, and to
make recommendations. The Child Welfare Board, in this instance, has made an investi-
gation and has made recommendation. This Board has appeared at this Public Hearing
and each individual member has testified. The Ordinance of the City with respect to
the revocation of a license requires a unanimous vote. In this particular case the
vote was four to one, and the recommendation of the Child Welfare Board was not
adopted by the Commission. You ask what purpose they serve. I think it is a
wonderful purpose. It is a community endeavor and every member of these boards,
including the Child Welfare Board, devotes their time and best abilities, without
compensation, to accomplish a public objective as to what is for the best welfare
and interest of the City. I think the City Commission, within my limited observa-
tions, relies very heavily on the recommendations of these boards and almost without
deviation, acts according to the recommendations made by the various boards.

JEAN BOMAN:	What chance is there of getting the nursery operators to adhere to rules

at this point when the rules are not enforced? What, then, are other
operators to do? We are in no position now to suggest if other nurseries will not
adhere to rules.

COMM. FOUNTAIN:	The roll has been called, and the case is lost. I appreciate and

7-23-59
respect the position of my colleague who voted against the revocation of this
license. I think the Child Welfare Board should be commended for the services
they do and this is just one of those times, in other words, a closed book. I
hope the Child Welfare Board will continue in their fine work.

COMM. WHIPPLE:	I thoroughly appreciate the work and hours put in by the Child

Welfare Board. I think you are doing a fine job and will continue

to do so.

MAYOR GRAGSON:	I definitely agree.

JEAN BOMAN:	But why should we continue if these rules are not enforced?

COMM. FOUNTAIN:	It is just one of those things. The hearing is over.

MAYOR GRAGSON:	I am going to say this and I hope that I speak for the entire

Board. This Board cannot and will not permit any infractions on
any licenses; on nursery licenses or any other licenses!

DORIS EVANS:	We appreciate the confidence four of you gave us this afternoon.

Commissioner Fountain moved the order to Show Cause be dismissed.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Elwell and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson
voting aye; noes, none.

PURCHASE REQUISITION	City Manager Kennedy requested approval of Purchase Requisition No. 6295 to the

Remodel Two Rooms in	Tobler and Oliver Construction Company for the lump sum bid in the amount of

Municipal Pool Building,                 $3,040.31. This requisition was for the remodelling of two rooms at the Municipal
One Room at Jefferson	Pool Building and one room at the Jefferson Recreation Center. Mr. Kennedy explained

Recreation Center	this was the lowest of two bids received and was within the Engineer's estimate.

APPROVED	Commissioner Fountain asked what the rooms were to be used for and Mr. Kennedy

stated they were to be multiple purpose rooms and could be used for craft classes,
square dancing, bridge tournaments and other like activities.

Commissioner Whipple moved Purchase Requisition No. 6295 to the Tobler and Oliver
Construction Company for the lump sum bid in the amount of $3,04)0.31 for the 
remodelling of two rooms at the Municipal Pool Building and one room at the Jefferson
Recreation Center be approved.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none.

OFFICER PERRY DELL	Commissioner	Fountain commended Perry Dell's work in this field	and moved he be

Authorized to Attend	given authorized leave to accompany the winners of the Soap Box	Derby to Akron,

Soap Box Derby in	Ohio, August	7 through August 20, 1959.

Akron, Ohio

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none.

CARSON AND OGDEN	Commissioner	Fountain stated that at the time Carson and Ogden were changed to 

TRAFFIC PATTERN	one-way streets,	according to the records he had been able to find, there was no petition

Approved	nor was there any public hearing held, and the City Manager advised the cost would

be from $800.00 to $1,000.00 to change these streets back to two-way. He continued
PROPOSED ORDINANCE	he believed for the benefit of the downtown shopping area that the traffic moving

Vehicle and Traffic	on these one-way streets was too fast and that two-way traffic would slow it down.

Referred to Committee	Commissioner Fountain moved Carson Street and Ogden Street be changed from one-way

to two-way streets from Main Street to 12th Street; this change to be made within a
time limit of 15 days, and proposed an ordinance entitled:	AN ORDINANCE REPEALING

ORDINANCE NO. 569 AND AMENDING SECTION 4 OF ORDINANCE NO. 750 ENTITLED: "AN 
ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 36, CODE OF LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, 1949, DEALING WITH THE 
REGULATION AND CONTROL OF VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC; BY PROVIDING FOR A BASIC SPEED LAW AND
PRIMA FACIE SPEED LIMIT; REGULATIONS FOR ENTERING AND EMERGING FROM AN ALLEY, 
DRIVEWAY OR BUILDING; PROCEDURE TO BE FOLLOWED IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT; REGULATIONS ON
ENTERING INTERSECTIONS CONTROLLED BY YIELD RIGHT OF WAY SIGNS; MARKING CURBS;
STANDING IN PASSENGER CURB LOADING ZONES; AND TRAFFIC ON ONE-WAY STREETS; PROVIDING
PENALTIES FOR THE VIOLATION OF THIS ORDINANCE; PROVIDING OTHER MATTERS PROPERLY
RELATED THERETO; AMENDING ORDINANCES 706, 470; REPEALING ALL ORDINANCES OR PARTS
OF ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT HEREWITH," BY DESIGNATING OGDEN STREET FROM MAIN TO 12TH
AND CARSON STREET FROM MAIN TO 12TH AS TWO-WAY STREETS; PROVIDING OTHER MATTERS
PROPERLY RELATED THERETO; PROVIDING PENALTIES FOR THE VIOLATION OF THIS ORDINANCE;
REPEALING ALL ORDINANCES OR PARTS OF ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT HEREWITH; AND PROVIDING
OTHER MATTERS PROPERLY RELATED THERETO.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Elwell and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Whipple and Mis Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye; 
Commissioner Sharp voted no stating there was to have been a meeting with the Traffic and
Parking Commission that never was held to his knowledge, and he thought this matter
should have been discussed with them. Commissioner Fountain stated this meeting
had been held by the Traffic and Parking Commission and the proposed change was
rejected. Commissioner Sharp stated this was not the meeting he had reference to
as the City Manager was to set up a meeting between the Traffic and Parking
Commission and the City Commission.

Mayor Gragson appointed Commissioners Whipple and Fountain as committee for recom-
mendation on the proposed ordinance which was read by title; and report to be made
at the regular meeting of the Board of City Commissioners to be held August 5, 1959.

7-23-59
JOE JULIAN LIQUOR STORE          His Honor Mayor Gragson stated the Commission would take up the matter of liquor
Package Liquor and	license application of Joe Julian and he asked Mr. Julian to state name and address

Beer Bar License	for which this application was requested. Mr. Julian answered stating that it was

for the Joe Julian Liquor Store,	Las Vegas Boulevard South.

Approved

	Madison Graves spoke on behalf of Mr. Julian and stated that since the last meeting

of the Commission, Mr. Julian had obtained 1,235 names of petitioners in favor of
allowing this license.

Mayor Gragson asked if any member of the Board would like any evidence as to who
will be the owner and operator, and who will receive any revenue from the business,
including slot machines. Commissioner Sharp stated that he was satisfied.

Commissioner Fountain moved that due to the confusion of the definition of "Shopping
Center" set up by the City, this license be approved.

Commissioner Sharp said that he would like to state one thing. In the past, eight
or ten such license applications in this area have been turned down; however, if
ever there was a shopping center this was one, and it was as much a shopping center
as any we have whether outlying or in town. On the basis that this Board had been
a little evasive in establishing population that limited this type of license. He
believed that this applicant had a clear cut legal right, and the Commission the
right to grant this type of license in a shopping center. Such licenses were granted
at Twin Lakes and one at Market Town, and certainly we can stand on the basis this is
a shopping center and have a valid reason to tell people why similar applications
have been turned down in this area before. Commissioner Sharp stated there would
be four others in the near future. Immediately adjacent to this location will be
the Tam Shopping Center, besides the Thrifty Mart on Charleston Boulevard and Loveland
on Bonanza and 25th Street, and another coming in on annexation of James Cashman prop-
erty which was recently approved.

Commissioner Sharp seconded the motion as he believed in all sincerity it was a
shopping center. Motion was carried by the following vote:	Commissioners Fountain,

Sharp and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye; Commissioner Elwell voting no; 
Commissioner Whipple stated that in view of new evidence and different bearing in this
case, he was still undecided; farther, that he was very conscious of the people who
had been rejected in the past and the concentration of this type of business in this
area; therefore, he passed his vote.

PACKAGE LIQUOR LICENSE	City Manager Kennedy presented the application of Elijah Pullens and Theodore

APPLICATION	Lawson for a package liquor license at the Westside Grocery, 322 Madison. Mr.

Westside Grocery Store               Kennedy advised this application had previously been denied by the Board of City

Commissioners on August 6, 1958, by reason that a resolution adopted June 20, 1956,
Denied	granting a variance to Mr. Pullens for the Westside Grocery specified that no liquor

was to be sold on the premises.

Mr. Kennedy stated the applicants had refused to accept the refund for the license
fee which was paid at the time they made application over a year ago.

Commissioner Sharp moved the application of Elijah Pullens and Theodore Lawson for
a package liquor license at the Westside Grocery, 322 Madison, be denied as before
and the License Department be instructed to refund the license fee to the applicants.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none.

DOWNTOWN IMPROVEMENT City Manager Kennedy referred the Commissioners to the memorandum from the City
DISTRICT	Manager's Office concerning the proposed program for the downtown improvements

within a district confined to the area that would be known as "The Downtown Area
Discussion	of the City of Las Vegas" and the matters which should be included in this plan.

He requested the Commissioners to study this tentative improvement plan and add
or delete any items which they deemed advisable. Mr. Kennedy did not think 
authorization to proceed on such a plan should come from anybody other than the City 
Commissioners.

Mr. Kennedy outlined the plan including the first step, which would be adopting
plans for an assessment district within this area. With regard to the parking, two
areas should be obtained for this purpose, one in the casino area just north of
Fremont Street and one in the merchant's area south of Fremont, as he doubted one
large parking facility could be worked out. If, and when, such lots were purchased,
a structure should be placed on one-half of each one that would provide facilities on
three stories for 558 cars; the other half to be used for parking lot purposes for
short-time parking until such time as it would be completed in the same manner.

This could be worked out on a Revenue Bond basis which would mean the merchants in the
downtown district would have to have their business licenses increased to offset their
payment, and the gaming casinos would also have to have their licenses increased. This
would have to be done by ordinance to have it completely legal and collectible. Then
the City could either operate these parking areas or put them out to lease as long as
there was sufficient money to repay the bonds.

Mayor Gragson asked if this would be two separate improvement districts - one for the
streets and one for the parking facilities. Mr. Kennedy stated that was correct and
one would be by assessment bonds, the other by revenue bonds. Commissioner Whipple
stated the revenue bonds would be backed by liquor and gaming licenses and by business
licenses.

Mr. Kennedy stated that in his opinion a district would have to be formed for parking
purposes from Main to 10th Streets and so much would have to be added to each license
on percentage. Commissioner Whipple was of the opinion that the businessmen on 8th,
9th, and 10th Streets would object, and Mr. Kennedy replied this could be confined to
wherever the Commission saw fit.

Commissioner Fountain stated that at a meeting held with the Director of Public Works
and a couple of the other department heads, the owners of the gambling interests in

7-23-59
the immediate downtown area made the statement they would pay the same money, pro
rata, among themselves for the area as was given to the Convention Center this
year. City Attorney Cory stated that would be a voluntary contribution. Mr.

Kennedy stated that would not be worth anything in regard to the bond issue.
Commissioner Fountain stated this would amount to 30 or 40 thousand dollars a
year. Mr. Kennedy was of the opinion the ordinance would have to be changed.

City Attorney Cory stated such a plan as mentioned by Commissioner Fountain
would not help the salability of the bonds.

Commissioner Sharp asked if the Commission had the authority to increase gas tax
in the City of Las Vegas, as he was of the opinion such an arrangement could not
be worked out with the downtown owners. Commissioner Sharp also raised the question
of people going out of business. Mr. Kennedy replied this would have to be based on
the license and the same fee be made by the new owners.

Mr. Kennedy reminded the Commission this was only a plan which was being presented
for their consideration and the financing would have to be worked out before it
could be actually entered into. Commissioner Whipple said everything should be
done to cooperate with the downtown people, and if they were willing, the 
Commission had an obligation. He further commended Mr. Sauer, Director of Public Works,
for the work he had already done in this regard.

Commissioner Sharp referred to the City of Miami Beach, Florida, and suggested
writing them to find out how they went about the creation of their parking area.

Mr. Kennedy said he was familiar with this and they had gone in and condemned the
property. Mr. Kennedy stated further the parking facilities could be rented and
the City could handle the construction of the buildings.

The third phase of the program outlined by Mr. Kennedy, which would run simultaneously
with the other two, was Building Code Enforcement and continuing inspections for the
purpose of getting rid of as many of the older buildings as possible with replacement
by newer type buildings which would continually up-grade the area; further, that
recommendations for the improvement of the older buildings must be made as required.

Mr. Kennedy stated that the area adopted as the "Downtown Area" be worked on 
continually for the purpose of making it convenient to get in and to get out of the
area and not just to establish a pattern and forget about it. The Assessment District 
would automatically widen certain streets which would allow these streets to
carry more traffic.

Commissioner Fountain commended the City Manager for his work on this project and
stated that at such time as the Commission or the City Manager saw lit to present
the proposed improvements for the downtown district, the business people should be
contacted by letter or should be called upon and a meeting arranged. City Manager
Kennedy stated this would be done and the Commissioners would be notified.

Director of Public Works Sauer presented a map of the area and the proposed 
improvements from Stewart to Bridger and from Main to 8th Street. He stated the intention
was to improve the streets throughout this area by providing street lighting and
improvement of alleys not presently improved. Bridger, Carson, Ogden and Stewart,
and 7th and 8th Streets would be widened and also proposal was recommended that 2nd
and 4th Streets be included in anticipation of increased traffic at the time of the
freeway. At the same time, sidewalks would be installed adjacent to the curb and
small parking areas that are an annoyance would be done away with. These streets
would be increased to 65 feet instead of 50 feet, allowing four traffic lanes and
two parking lanes; sidewalks would be reduced to 7½feet. Mr. Sauer added that so
far the district had been set up on a front footage basis but the intention was not
to present that if the bonding company would allow the use of a percentage basis,
and the attorney believed this could be worked out.

City Attorney Coiy stated that he had not indicated the district could be based on
a benefit basis for proposed improvements where all property was not actually 
improved and for that reason bonding attorneys were being consulted. He added that
Mr. Whitmore, Deputy City Attorney, was investigating this possibility and was
presently waiting for an answer from the bonding attorney.

Commissioner Sharp stated if this plan would be adopted, the Clark County 
Commissioners should be notified as they were presently in contract for the installation
of curb and street lights in a part of the affected area. Mr. Sauer said he was
aware of this situation and would get in touch with them.

Mr. Sauer presented the problem of street cleaning on Fremont from 3rd to Main
Street and, after some discussion, it was recommended that this problem be taken
up with the downtown operators at the same time the improvements were discussed.

Mr. Kennedy stated there was one thing more to be brought up when this meeting is
held and that was the all-day use of parking meters by employees, whereas the 
intention for these meters was for one-hour parking. He suggested marking these cars,
which had been done in the past, to determine whether it was local people or tourists.

HEALTH REPORT	Dr. D. D. Carr, Clark County Health Officer, presented a report to the Commissioners

Westside Establishments	in regard to establishments on the Westside. He stated his department had gone over

Dr. D. D. Carr, County	there on the past Monday and visited the Louisiana Club, New Town Tavern, Brown Derby,

Health Officer	The El Rio Club, and the El Morocco Club with the understanding a check was desired

on the club area.

Dr. Carr reported a number of these places were in good condition. The El Morocco
was in good condition, the El Rio Club had only some small repairs and painting to
do in the toilet rooms and he believed this work might already have been completed,
and one of his men was checking today. The New Town Tavern had only one mark against
them in regard to the springs on the ladies' toilet room doors; they had a question
on dish washing and were reinstructed in this regard, and as to their cleaning up of
the garbage cans, Dr. Carr understood they were working on the discrepancies and his
men had been in there daily all this week.

In regard to the Brown Derby, Dr. Carr stated they had a number of marks but not too
awfully bad, and they had been given notice to clean up. They had really been hard

7-23-59
at work at it.

The Louisiana Club, however, was the worst place over there and it was really
filthy. Mr. Z. Louis had agreed to correct the following items:

1.	The floors, walls, and ceilings were dirty throughout the building.

2.	Hundreds of gum drops on the floor.

3.	Toilet doors not self-closing,
4.      Toilet rooms filthy dirty.

5.               Improper dishwashing.

Dr. Carr continued stating instructions had been given regarding the dishwashing on
	Monday, but by Wednesday the proper procedure was not being followed. He explained

this man would listen but didn't respond very well. Furthermore, in the rear there
were 12 stinking, dirty garbage cans, all without lids. Also, there was water running 
on the ground between the storeroom and the kitchen. The walk-in cooler box
had dirt up to the lath on the floor and was very dirty. There was food stored on
the ground. Waste material dropped on food that was not protected from contamination
On the alley and street side of the building there was glass and debris which would
require a truck to haul it away. A general paint job was needed throughout.

Dr. Carr stated that Mr. Louis agreed to clean up his place within seven days and
further agreed to have all necessary painting and other corrections completed within
ten days. He had been warned if this was not accomplished within the specified time
his permit would be taken away and closure would be recommended.

Commissioner Fountain asked Dr. Carr if Mr. Louis was cooperating and Dr. Carr stated
he had been on another assignment all day and did not know what had been accomplished
Dr. Carr added one thing. He had failed to mention that the Louisiana Club had been
graded and posted with a Grade "C" Card on the comer door, side door, and on the
cafeteria, and this type of rating could not be allowed in excess of 30 days.

Mayor Gragson thanked Dr. Carr for a very good report.

-oOo-

There being no further business to come before the Board, at the hour of 5:50 p.m.
Commissioner Fountain moved this meeting adjourn.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none.

SHOW CAUSE HEARING          At the last regular meeting of the Board of City Commissioners held July 15, 1959,
Smokey Cigarette Company         the Smokey Cigarette Company, Ray Eckl, owner, was cited to appear before the Board

of Commissioners at this time to show cause, if any he had, why his cigarette vending 
Show Cause Order Dismissed         operators license should not be revoked.

Mr. Eckl was present and spoke in his own behalf. He stated that at the time he did
not know he was violating the ordinance when he loaned the operators of the Nevada
Vending Machine Company his machines. Commissioner Whipple asked him if these people
came to him and told him they were having trouble with their license.

Mr. Eckl replied they said they had had license and there was some difficulty but
they thought it would be only a matter of a short time before it was straightened
out. In answer to Commissioner Whipple's question he stated there were only five of
his machines involved.

Commissioner Sharp asked if Mr. Eckl had gone to Mr. Hart or Mr. Finn and told them
he had no machines and wanted to borrow their machines, and Mr. Eckl replied that he



7-23-59 and 8/5/59
had loaned them his machines but did not borrow any of theirs. Commissioner
Fountain asked how many machines did they operate and Mr. Eckl stated they were
listed in the affidavit he had previously submitted.

Commissioner Sharp stated he appreciated Mr. Eckl's coming forward with the truth
in this matter. Chief Sheffer said Mr. Eckl had not concealed information. Mr. Eckl
regretted his part in this matter and said he would not let it happen again.

Commissioner Sharp moved the show cause order issued to Ray Eckl, owner, Smokey

LIQUOR APPLICATION	Mayor Gragson requested that the action taken at the Special Meeting of the Board of

Joe Julian Liquor Store	City Commissioners approving Joseph Julian's application for a package liquor and

beer bar license at the Joe Julian Liquor Store, 2400 Las Vegas Boulevard South, be
Approval of July 23, 1959                   rescinded as there was some question as to the legality of this action which was
Rescinded and	taken at this Special Meeting held July 23, 1959.

Approved	At this point John Spann, Attorney, addressed the Board stating that he was representing 

the Clark County Licensed Beverage Association and he would like to request
the Commission to defer action on this application until a full Board was present.

He continued that he understood Commissioner Elwell was presently vacationing in
Canada and further, that he had sent a telegram to the Mayor requesting action on
this application be held until his return.

Commissioner Sharp asked Mr. Spann if he had contacted Commissioner Elwell to send
this telegram and he replied he had requested that a message be transmitted to him
when he was unable to reach him by telephone. Mr. Spann added that subsequently he
had heard a telegram had been sent.

Madison Graves, Attorney, spoke on behalf of his client, Joseph Julian, stating
Commissioner Elwell would vote no in any event. He added that Mr. Julian had made
commitments in excess of $25,000.00.

Mr. Spann stated the Commission Minutes would show that this application was deferred
two or three times for the reason that the entire Commission was not present; furthermore,
 he would like to point out that at the regular meeting of July 15, 1959, it was
denied. Mr. Spann made reference to City Ordinance No. 688, which allows one such
license to each 1,000 population, including shopping centers and grocery stores, and
stated 43 licenses were presently issued and he believed the Commission intended to
reserve the remaining two for the outlying east or west area of this town. He asked
Mr. Bills, Director of Planning, as to whether or not the City has any definition of
a shopping center in the zoning ordinances.

City Attorney Cory answered stating that insofar as liquor licenses are concerned
there was no definition of a shopping center and as to such a definition in the
zoning ordinance, he was not prepared to state whether or not this was defined.

Mr. Spann said there was an open question as to whether or not this was a shopping
center, which the Commission must resolve.

Mayor Gragson stated that it was their belief that this was a shopping center and
asked Mr. Spann if he would question whether or not this was a shopping center. He
replied he did not believe it was by reason that it was under different roofs.

BID OPENING 59.52	This being the time heretofore set for Bid Opening No. 59.52 for the refrigeration

Refrigeration Unit at                     unit at the Dula Memorial Building, bid was received as follows:

Dula Memorial Building

A. R. Ruppert Plumbing and Heating, Inc. $ 2,292.00

Referred to Public Works

Commissioner Sharp moved the foregoing bid be referred to the City Manager and
Director of Public Works for recommendation.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye; noes, none.
Absent:	Commissioner Elwell.

LIQUOR APPLICATION              At this time Mr. Spann stated that he did not understand the Mayor's request for a
Joe Julian Liquor Store                   motion to rescind the action approving the Joe Julian application which was taken
Continued	on July 23, 1959, at the Special Meeting of the Commission.

Commissioner Whipple moved the action of the City Commission taken at the Special
Meeting on July 23, 1959, approving the application of Joseph Julian for a package
liquor and beer bar license at 2400 Las Vegas Boulevard South, be rescinded.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye; noes, none.
Absent:	Commissioner Elwell.

Mr. Spann again requested the Commission to defer any further action on this application 
until the return of Commissioner Elwell. Mayor Gragson asked Mr. Spann if this
telegram had been sent at his request and he replied that on the basis that

8-5-59
Commissioner Elwell was informed at his request as to what had occurred by a 
telephone call by another party and in the message conveyed to him (Mr. Spann), 
Commissioner Elwell had said he would send a telegram to this effect.

His Honor Mayor Gragson asked on what grounds was the issuance of the license being
opposed. A discussion regarding the population followed and Mr. Spann referred
again to Ordinance No. 688 which was adopted in January, 1956, wherein the population
was set at 45,000 and further, that the population should be determined by the
Board of Commissioners annually in December of each year. (Section 19, Ord. No. 688).
Mr. Spann added that the Commission had not redetermined the population and for that
reason it might be said there was no authority for any licenses on the basis of popu-
lation.

Mayor Gragson asked if he understood him correctly that the application was being
opposed on the population basis. Mr. Spann replied that was one of the many 
objections in view of the fact the Commission did not act in 1958 to redetermine the 
population.

Commissioner Sharp stated that Mr. Spann had said there were two licenses available
according to the population of 45,000. Mr. Spann replied the License Director had
told him there were two licenses open and he had based that statement according to
this information.

Attorney Graves said that Mr. Spann had made a positive statement to the Board that
there were two licenses open and the matter as to whether or not this was a shopping
center had been gone into by this Board before. He believed they were wasting time.
Attorney Spann brought out the fact that the application had been previously denied
and His Honor Mayor Gragson stated it had been denied contingent on whether or not
this was a shopping center.

In reply to Mr. Spann's question as to whether or not a new application had been 
submitted, Mayor Gragson read Joe Julian's letter of July 17, 1959, requesting 
resubmission of his application. City Attorney Cory advised that ordinance does not
require a new application and that this application is pending before the Commission
without any question. He continued that despite the fact the action of July 23, 1959,
had been rescinded, it would still be before the Board.

Mayor Gragson stated he had received the telegram from Commissioner Elwell and it was
his understanding it would be some time in September before he would be back in town.

Commissioner Sharp asked if there were any others present in protest and a count of
hands revealed there were approximately eleven members of the Clark County Licensed
Beverage Association present. Mr. Spann said they were objecting on the same grounds,
and further, he presented to the Board a petition signed by a number of businessmen
in this area who were objecting for the same reasons, as well as a financial statement 
of the Western Liquor Store showing a net loss backing up the statement that
another license of this type would be detrimental to business. Commissioner Sharp
asked who prepared this statement and was informed it was prepared by an accountant
by the name of Miller.

Mr. Murray Peterson of the Round-Up Liquor Store stated that he was opposed to the
issuance of this license and he had presented his objections at the meeting on July
15, 1959.

Commissioner Fountain stated he would like to ask a question of Mr. Springston whose
name he saw at the top of the petition which had been presented. He asked Mr.
Springston if he owned the Las Vegas Bowl. Mr. Springston replied that he did, and
also that he was the President of the Clark County Licensed Beverage Association
and in that capacity he was objecting to this application and if there were any
discrepancies they should be thoroughly looked into, and if it was illegal it should
not be granted. Furthermore, they were not opposing any individual but in view of
the fact that liquor licenses are regulated by local, State, and County agencies,
these regulations should be followed.

Mayor Gragson asked if there were any others who wished to protest and Mr. Spann
presented a map showing the liquor outlets near the Francisco Square Shopping Center
and also stated he understood there will soon be another shopping center on San
Francisco between the Robinson Apartments and the Union Pacific Railroad tracks.
Commissioner Fountain said there were going to be a lot of shopping centers. Mr.

Spann said he was submitting this point because this Board had objected to congestion
of this type of license.

Mr. Spann asked if there was any other person listed on this application other than
Mr. Julian; specifically, if Sam Josephson's name was on it. Mr. Julian responded
to this question stating that he was sick and tired of being accused of having a
secret partner. He stated he had said before and he would say it again, there was
no one else involved but himself and himself alone.

In answer to Mr. Spann's question he was informed this application was for a package
liquor and beer bar license. Mr. Spann stated that inasmuch as the Commission had
determined this was a shopping center he would like to point out Section 3 - (16) of
Ordinance No. 688 stating a shopping center or grocery liquor license shall permit
the sale of alcoholic liquors only for off-premise consumption. City Attorney Cory
pointed out this application was for the combined license of a package liquor and
beer bar.

Commissioner Sharp asked Mr. Graves how many square feet were contained in this
shopping center and he informed him it was 41,000 square feet. Commissioner Fountain
asked Mr. Spann if he realized how much of an investment a shopping center would 
represent. He continued that he thought the Commission had been very, very fair and they
had come to a point where they had to take a stand.

Commissioner Fountain moved the application of Joseph Julian for a package liquor and

from R-4 to C-1.

Approved

This application was previously approved by the Board of City Commissioners and the

of the Planning Commission it was deleted from this proposed ordinance and returned
for further study. Approval was again recommended by the Planning Commission with
the stipulation that, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 24, Section 20,
Paragraph E of the Zoning Ordinance, the use of this property be limited to development 
generally as shown on the plot plan submitted by the applicant dated June 23,

1959, O. J. Scherer, Engineer. There was one protest.

REZONING Z-18-59	The Commission considered the application of Baumgardner, Baumgardner and Hill for

and Hill	block north of Fremont Street, legally described as Lots 14, 15, and 16, Block 9,

Ladd Addition, from R-3 to R-4.

Held in Abeyance

Denial was recommended by the Planning Commission on the basis that it would 
constitute spot zoning and because this area is already developed a change in zoning would
create an undesirable land use pattern. There were no protests. Planning Director
Bills stated the Planning Commission discussed the rezoning at two meetings, held a
public hearing, and made a field trip before reaching their decision. Mr. Bills
stated further the vast majority of this area is developed in accordance with R-3.

Mr. Baumgardner addressed the Commission stating that he would like to clarify this.

He stated he had a petition signed by all the property owners in the area and they
were all agreeable to this rezoning; further, he stated he had sufficient off-street
parking for 20 cars and the plot plan showing these spaces where they would create no
nuisance. He was of the opinion his plan would be an asset to the City and the
neighborhood. He added there was spot zoning all around in the area. In view of the
fact there were no protests he could not understand the Planning Commission rejecting
his application as long as he complied with all of the ordinances.

Commissioner Sharp stated it was the consensus of the Planning Commission that the
whole area might be developed to R-4 if this rezoning was approved.

Commissioner Fountain moved the application of Baumgardner, Baumgardner, and Hill
for the reclassification of property located on the west side of 14th Street, one-half 
block north of Fremont, legally described as Lots 14, 15, and 16, Block 9,

Ladd Addition, from R-3 to R-4 be held in abeyance.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye; noes, none.
Absent:	Commissioner Elwell.

REZONING Z-20-59	The Commission considered the application of Aune, Campbell, and Brinkmeyer for

Aune, Campbell, and                 reclassification of property bounded by Sunrise and 21st Streets parallel to Fremont
Brinkmeyer	Street, legally described as a portion of the SE^, SW4, NE^, Section 35* T 20 S,

R 61 E, from R-3 to R-ip. Planning Director Bills advised that the Planning Commis-
Denied	sion recommended denial and 60 protests were received from property owners; the

reason for these protests was due to the parking situation.

Commissioner Fountain moved the application of Aune, Campbell, and Brinkmeyer for
reclassification of property bounded by Sunrise and 21st Streets parallel to Fremont
Street, legally described as a portion of the SE¼, SW¼, NE¼, Section 35, T 20 S,

R 61 E, from R-3 to R-4 be denied as recommended by the Planning Commission.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye; noes, none.
Absent:	Commissioner Elwell.

RE20NING Z-9-58	The Commission again considered the application of Dr. D. N. Leavitt for the

Dr. D. N. Leavitt	reclassification of property located on the south side of West Charleston Boulevard

between Highland Drive and Desert Lane from R-1 and R-4 to C-2.

Held in Abeyance

This application was presented to the Planning Commission on July 10, 1958, and a
public hearing was held. The Board of Trustees of the First Presbyterian Church
submitted a letter urging that all zoning requests of this type in this area be
deferred until such time as the route of the freeway was definitely established.

Denial was recommended by a unanimous vote of the Planning Commission on the grounds
that the Commission had determined in the public interest that the most appropriate
use of land in the West Charleston area west of Highland Drive was residential except
for necessary neighborhood shopping facilities, and that the granting of a commercial
classification on this property would inevitably lead to requests for further unwarranted 
commercial zoning in this area.

The recommendation of the Planning Commission was presented to the City Commission on
July 16, 1958, and was continued on the request of the applicant until August 8, 1958,
at which time the City Commission voted to hold this application in abeyance until
completion of the Master Plan. The tentative Master Plan which the Planning Commission
proposes to present at a public hearing on September 3, 1959, designates this area
for residential uses.

Commissioner Whipple asked how long it would take to adopt this Master Plan and
Planning Director Bills stated it would depend on questions, problems and determinations 
as a result of Planning Commission hearings and subsequent City Commission hearings.

Dr. Leavitt stated he had had this property for four years and his proposed development 
of the property was a drive-in root beer stand and he presented a picture of the
building. After some discussion the Commission was of the opinion this property should
not remain R-1 and some action should be taken so Dr. Leavitt could develop it. Mr.
Bills had suggested the logical answer would be some sort of transitional use. It
was recommended a meeting between the City Commission and the Planning Commission in
regard to this rezoning application be held.

Commissioner Sharp moved the application of Dr. D. N. Leavitt for the reclassification 
of property located on the south side of West Charleston Boulevard between
Highland Drive and Desert Lane, from R-1 and R-4 to C-2, be held in abeyance, and a
meeting between the City Commission and the Planning Commission be held at 5:00 p.m.,
Monday, August 10, 1959, in the Council Chamber at the City Hall.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye; noes, none.
Absent:	Commissioner Elwell.

services satisfactory.

investigated and he could get recommendation from the County as they were presently
under contract with them. He believed his company was entitled to a share of the
City's business.

City without insurance and had been called into the License Department. He
replied at that particular time the insurance had been cancelled without his
knowledge and that he presently had insurance as well as new and adequate equipment. 
Commissioner Fountain asked what was the average age of his drivers, and
Mr. Curtis advised they were all over 25 years of age. Commissioner Fountain stated
he would be in favor of an investigation.

made regarding the Las Vegas Emergency Ambulance Service with report to be made back

Commission

Deputy Director of Planning, Donald Saylor, advised the Commission that there had been
no protests to this application at the public hearing held by the Planning Commission;
however, there was a petition from adjoining property owners indicating they were in
approval. He stated further that the Planning Commission had recommended denial on
the basis that this would be spot zoning and if these three lots were rezoned to R-4
it would result in a mixture of land uses. In order to get around this problem, it
was suggested this whole R-3 zone be considered for rezoning to R-4.

Mr. Baumgardner was present and stated his plans were to increase his units from 12
to 20 and that there was ample parking facilities and everything necessary to comply
with all the ordinances.

Commission with the recommendation that serious consideration be given the rezoning

PROPOSED ORDINANCE	At this time consideration was given the proposed Motel Ordinance which was 

Motel Ordinance	introduced and read by title at	the regular meeting of the Board of City Commissioners

held August 5, 1959, and referred to Commissioners Fountain and Whipple, committee
Continued	for recommendation.

Mr. Leigh Ellsworth of the Motel Association addressed the Commission stating there
was a question whether or not anything should be done in this regard until the
Supreme Court made a decision regarding the constitutionality of the State Law or
until such time as existing State Statutes could be amended or repealed. He continued 
that since the State Law went into effect Las Vegas had received the most
favorable results from the touring public as had been experienced in the last ten
years, a fact that is contributed to not having price signs; however, the law states
nothing about figures whether misleading or not. This was the reason the Motel
Association felt the need of this proposed ordinance which would eliminate this
possibility and help the operators as it might be some time before the Supreme
Court decision would be made.

Commissioner Fountain and Commissioner Whipple were of the opinion that cooperation
should be given this group and were gratified at the harmony which presently exists
in the industry; however, Commissioner Whipple asked City Attorney, Calvin Cory, for
a statement in this regard.

City Attorney Cory advised that he had not discussed this proposed ordinance with
Mr. Ellsworth, but that he had talked with Mr. Empey, Mr. Barringer, and the District
Attorney. He continued that because he was so much in support of what they were
trying to accomplish, he felt it was unwise for the Motel Organization to wish the
adoption of this ordinance until the Supreme Court decided the constitutionality of
the State Law; and furthermore, the adoption of such an ordinance might prejudice
the argument of the case in the Supreme Court. He added that Attorney Posen, who
represents eleven motel owners, would be able to take advantage in the Supreme

8-19-59
Court of any decision of a District Court which might hold such an ordinance 
unconstitutional.

Mr. Cory pointed out that this proposed Motel Ordinance had been introduced as 
submitted by the Motel Association and felt it should not be enacted in its present
form. Mr. Ellsworth stated they would not object to the City Attorney going over
it. Mr. Cory stated that if it was going to be a function of his office to enforce
this ordinance, he believed that he should be in agreement that it was enforceable.

At the conclusion of this discussion, Mayor Gragson stated consideration of this 
proposed ordinance would be continued.

WESTERNER CLUB	Chief of Police, Ray Sheffer, advised the Commission that the Westerner Club and

each corporate member had not complied with the request of the City Commission at
Financial Statements	their regular meeting held July 15, 1959, in regard to the filing of financial statements 

Requested	for the club itself as well as for each member. Chief Sheffer stated further

that a financial report of May 31, 1959, had been submitted by the Westerner Club,
and a financial report of May 1, 1959, had been received from George Arquilla; however,
no report had been filed by Mr. Pepple and Mr. Hart.

Chief Sheffer requested that notice be sent notifying the Corporation and each 
stockholder to file a financial statement current to July 13, 1959, with the License Bureau
of the Police Department on or before the 31st day of August, 1959.

Commissioner Sharp moved The Westerner Club, Inc., and the corporation owners, George
Arquilla, Joseph K. Hart, and Harold P. Pepple be notified to file financial statements 
current to July 13, 1959, with the License Bureau of the Police Department on
or before August 31, 1959.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye; noes, none.
Absent:	Commissioner Elwell.

BRUCE TRENT	Commissioner Sharp stated that he wished to commend Bruce Trent, Superintendent of

Superintendent of	Recreation, and his staff for the fine manner the banquet for the presentation of

Recreation	awards for the Little League was conducted, as well as for the entire Little League

Baseball Program. Commissioner Sharp added that he felt Mr. Trent had done a 
Commendation	tremendous job and that it was a wonderful thing. Commissioners Fountain and Whipple

expressed their regrets at not being able to attend the banquet due to previous
commitments. Mayor Gragson stated he had attended and enjoyed it very much.

Commissioner Fountain moved Bruce Trent and his staff be commended for their work
in connection with the Little League Baseball activities and that this commendation
be noted in the minutes.

HOLLYWOOD SPORTSBOOK      Chief of Police, Ray Sheffer, advised that Show Cause Hearing for Clabe F. Hall's

Sportsbook License at the Hollywood Sportsbook, 115 North First Street, was being
Cited to Show Cause                   requested as a result of the inattendance to the license on Saturday, Sunday, and
September 16, 1939, and               Monday, August 22, 23, and 24, 1959, at which time bets were accepted on Saturday
to Remain Closed	amounting to several hundred dollars; bets that were won and not paid.

He continued that after receiving a report of this situation, a check was made and
it was found the business was under the control of a person who was not licensed and
not in possession of a valid registration under ordinance; however, since that time
Mr. Hall had submitted a letter to the Mayor and Commissioners indicating his reason
for this inattendance. (At this point the aforementioned letter was shown to the

Commission).

Commissioner Fountain moved that Clabe F. Hall, operator of the Hollywood Sportsbook,
115 North 1st, be cited to appear before the Board of City Commissioners at 7:30 p.m.,
September 16, 1959, to show cause, if any he had, why his Sportsbook License should
not be revoked.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson -voting aye; noes, none.
Absent:	Commissioner Elwell.

Chief Sheffer further advised that the Hollywood Sportsbook was presently closed and
requested this license remain in suspension until hearing had been held. Commissioner
Whipple asked if Clabe Hall was present, and Mr. Hall stepped forward to speak in his
own behalf.

Commissioner Fountain told him they had just read his letter and asked if there was
anything he would like to state. Mr. Hall replied that he fully realized the mistake
he had made and that his future was at stake and he assured the Commission he would
do anything required to permit him to continue in his business and that he would be
at the place of business 12 or 14 hours a day, or however long it was necessary, and
that nothing unfavorable would ever come up again.

Commissioner Whipple asked him if he considered his license worth very much and Mr.

Hall answered that he did. Then Commissioner Whipple asked him why he did not take
care of his license. Mr. Hall stated that he had committed a grave error which he
realized, and he would do anything in the world to keep his license. Commissioner
Sharp asked if the wagers had been paid off and Chief Sheffer advised at the present
time partial payment had been made to both winners and they had been given promissory
notes by Mr. Hall for the balance due them. Commissioner Sharp said he would like to
know what the financial status was of the establishment and City Attorney Cory stated
that the solvency of this business could be established at the show cause hearing.

Commissioner Fountain moved that due to the seriousness of the situation, the Hollywood
Sportsbook, 115 North 1st Street, remain closed until such time as show cause hearing
had been held.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye; noes, none.
Absent:	Commissioner Elwell.

The Commission considered the application of Bernice Butterfield for a variance to
allow Margaret Frisbie to operate a rest home for the aged at 713 Linden, legally
described as Lots 9 and 10, Block 8, Buck's Subdivision, in an R-3 zone.

Approval was recommended by the Board of Zoning Adjustment on the basis that the
property is presently used as a boarding house (legal non-conforming use) and that
there would not be much difference between the present use and the proposed one.

There were no protests. Deputy Director of Planning advised the Commission that the
building had been checked by the Building Department and the Fire Department, and met
the code.

Commissioner Fountain moved the application of Bernice Butterfield for a variance to
allow Margaret Frisbie to operate a rest home for the aged at 713 Linden, legally
described as Lots 9 and 10, Block 8, Buck's Subdivision, in an R-3 zone, be approved
as recommended by the Board of Zoning Adjustment subject to the following conditions:

1. That the housing of patients be restricted to the first floor of the building.

2. That the rest home permit be subject to annual inspections by the License Depart-
ment and that it be non-transferable.

3.	That the applicant agree to enter into an assessment district for the installation
of improvements when such a district is formed for this area.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye; noes, none.
Absent:	Commissioner Elwell.

The Commission considered the application of Jessie M. O'Day for a use permit to
allow Virgil Sells to operate a wedding chapel at 222 South 2nd Street, legally 
described as Lots 22 and 23, Block 13, Clarks Las Vegas Townsite in a C-1 zone.

Deputy Director of Planning, Donald Saylor, advised the Commission that Virginia
Ball was granted a use permit to operate a wedding chapel at this address two years
ago; however, this use permit was revoked in July of this year primarily because Mrs.
Ball had misrepresented herself as the owner of the property and certain improvements
she had agreed to had not been completed.

Denial was recommended by the Board of Zoning Adjustment on the basis that it was not
proper to grant a use permit to conduct a use which was not permitted by the ordinance. 
There were no protests. Mr. Saylor advised further that the wedding chapel
had been operating pending action on this application.

Commissioner Sharp asked if this whole area was not being considered for C-2 zoning
and Mr. Saylor replied that it was and the hesitancy to recommend C-2 zoning had been
primarily due to parking requirements. He added the Planning Commission had under
study at this time a proposed ordinance amendment that would somewhat take care of
this situation. Director of Public Works Sauer stated this area would also come
under the proposed downtown improvement district.

Commissioner Sharp moved this application be held in abeyance. (This motion failed
for the lack of a second).

Commissioner Whipple moved this application be denied as recommended by the Board of
Zoning Adjustment.

9-2-59
Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and the vote was as follows:	

Commissioners Fountain and Whipple voting aye; Commissioner Sharp and His Honor Mayor
Gragson voting no. Absent:	Commissioner Elwell. (This motion failed to carry).

At this time, Herman Adams, Attorney for Mr. Sells, addressed the Commission stating
that his client was not notified of any of these conditions and that he had merely
been notified that Mrs. Ball had unintentionally made a misrepresentation. He added
there were similar operations in the area and if it was going to be rezoned to C-2
as Commissioner Sharp had suggested, he could not see what damage this would do.
Commissioner Sharp pointed out that he had made reference to this being considered
for C-2 zoning. Commissioner Whipple stated that it might be some time before such
a change might come about. Attorney Adams stated he would like to ask that this
matter be held in abeyance.

Commissioner Whipple moved the application of Jessie M. O'Day for a use permit to
allow Virgil Sells to operate a wedding chapel at 222 South 2nd Street, legally 
described as Lots 22 and 23, Block 13, Clarks Las Vegas Townsite, in a C-1 zone, be
referred to the Planning Commission for study in regard to the rezoning of this area.

JUVENILE FORESTRY	Chief of Police, Ray Sheffer, presented Judge David Zenoff, who spoke on behalf of

CAMP DISCUSSION	those actively engaged in the plans to establish a forestry camp for the rehabilitation 

and correction of the youths of our area. He stated that Chief Sheffer and
Resolution to	Sheriff Leypoldt also had been active in wo iking toward such a camp and that a 

be Prepared	suitable site had been located in the mountains southwest of here.

Judge Zenoff invited the Commissioners to explore this site with them on Saturday.

He explained this property was known as the Robert's Ranch and consisted of 
approximately 160 acres which were fed directly by three springs; there being fifteen springs
in the entire area. It was felt this land could be acquired for an amount between
$10,000.00 and $13,500.00. Here the boys would be confined without fences in a remote
spot from which it would be difficult to escape without danger. It would take two
years, starting with pup tents and building the camp, before reforestation and area
work could be contemplated.

It had been further proposed, Judge Zenoff continued, that the boys graze their own
cattle for milk and beef; also, truck farming could be entered into. Trained personnel 
would be needed to direct the boys' activities, both recreational and occupational. 
These boys would have to be fed and provided with bedding, clothing and
other necessities. From the State of California a trained director could be hired
for $6,000.00 a year.

City cooperation is needed for contribution of funds for personnel and food. The Trade
Unions have promised trained personnel to periodically instruct the boys in the building 
trades with the promise that any who graduate would be placed in jobs as apprentices.
Service Clubs had offered to furnish beds, cots, blankets. Judge Zenoff continued there
was to be a meeting with the County Commissioners on September 8, and it was hoped at
that time to get their approval for the purchase of the land. With all these things
this would have to be made an official authority. It was felt that the operation of
this camp should be restricted and confined under Clark County and control be retained
here. He advised the State wished to cooperate with the project and perhaps eventually
take it over; however, it was preferred the control remain here, but that was a 
problem for the future.

Judge Zenoff stated under present Statutes the use of Elko serves no good purpose for
the borderline case. It was not proposed to put into this forestry camp the boy who
was beyond hope; however, for those who could be rehabilitated by regular feeding,
hard work, training, working together and cleaning their bodies as well as their
minds, at such a camp as was being proposed, the job could be accomplished. He 
requested the Commission to adopt a resolution to the effect that the City would 
participate and cooperate in the establishment of this Youth Forestry Camp.

City Attorney Cory asked Judge Zenoff if it was desired that a single contribution be
made for the acquisition of the land or an annual contribution towards maintenance
and operation of the camp. Judge Zenoff stated they were interested in the operational
costs. He added the camp would be operated under the jurisdiction of the Juvenile
Court by joint City-County participation and would not include a non-profit 
corporation.

Commissioner Fountain compared participation in this program with the present agreement
the City has with the Clark County Health Department. Commissioner Whipple commended
Chief Sheffer, Sheriff Leypoldt, and Judge Zenoff for the efforts they had made in
this field and expressed their desire to help and support this movement.

Commissioner Fountain moved that the City Attorney be instructed to draw up an 
appropriate resolution supporting the establishment of a Youth Forestry Camp to be presented
at the next regular meeting of the Board of City Commissioners.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye; noes, none.
Absent:	Commissioner Elwell.

CHARLESTON HEIGHTS #10A Director of Public Works Sauer advised the final plat for Charleston Heights #10A,

submitted by Charleston Heights, Inc., Ernest A Becker, President, had been checked
Acceptance of	and it was recommended that it be accepted.

Final Plat

City Attorney Cory advised that he had met with Mr. Becker and his counsel, G. William
Coulthard, and an agreement, similar to the one required from Louis Miranti in 
connection with Golfridge Terrace Subdivision, had been signed guarantying continued supply
of water. This agreement empowers the City, as his agent, to transfer all right and
title, including the source of the water, to the Water District if he should be unable
to supply water; however, Mr. Becker shall continue to operate and receive revenues.

Mr. Cory felt that the City was amply protected by this agreement which runs for a
period of ten years, and that the City had gone as far as it could possibly go to
assure water for these residents; furthermore, he thought Mr. Becker should be 
commended for his fine cooperation.

REZONING (Z-9-58)	The Commission again considered the application of Dr. Darryl N. Leavitt for the

Darryl N. Leavitt	reclassification of property located on the south side of West Charleston Boulevard

between Highland Drive and Desert Lane from R-1 and R-4 to C-2. This application was
Public Hearing	held in abeyance at the regular meeting of August 5, 1959.

September 16, 1959

Commissioner Whipple stated that this application had been pending for some time and
he was of the opinion they ought to act on it and he had hoped the Planning Commission
would have had a recommendation for them at this time. Commissioner Sharp stated he
had attended the Planning Commission and the owners in the area are opposed to any
commercial zoning but did not object to R-4, which would allow a medical center and
other use permits that could be controlled. He added that a petition to this effect
had been filed.

Commissioner Whipple asked if a root beer stand was allowable in an R-4 zoning and

9-2-59
was informed that it was not. He then asked what the Planning Commission proposed
this property be used for. Deputy Director of Planning; Donald Saylor, advised that
the only evidence of a proposal by the Planning Commission was this whole portion of
West Charleston should remain in some form of residential zoning.

Commissioner Whipple stated the question before them was Dr. Leavitt's application
and inasmuch as his property was adjacent to industrial it seemed good planning that
this should be zoned commercial. Commissioner Sharp stated he would admit there was
a peculiarity here to be considered.

After some discussion Commissioner Sharp moved Public Hearing be held at 8:00 p.m. on
September 16, 1959, in the Council Chambers of the City Hall, regarding Darryl N.
Leavitt's application for the reclassification of property located on the south side
of West Charleston Boulevard between Highland Drive and Desert Lane, from R-1 and R-4

CIGARETTE VENDING	The Commission considered the application of Ralph T. Warne for a Cigarette Vending

OPERATOR LICENSE	Operator License at the Ralph T. Warne Vending Machine Company, 8 E. Charleston.

George Dickerson, Attorney, spoke on behalf of his partner Charles Miles, and
Ralph T. Warne	presented the Commission with a	number of affidavits which had	been prepared in

Vending Mach. Co.	regard to the applicant, Ralph T. Warne, by	people he had been	associated with in the

past attesting to his honesty and diligence.

9-16-59
Mr. Dickerson pointed out that on June 19th of this year a cigarette vending operator
license had been erroneously issued to the Nevada Vending Machine Company, Inc., of
Held in Abeyance	which Mr. Warne was a corporate member, and said company became obligated for $26,000

worth of machines and equipment and placed machines at several locations. Mr. Dickerson 
continued that subsequently the company was informed this license had been issued
in error as it had not had City Commission approval. At that time arrangements were
made for Mr. Eckl of the Smokey Cigarette Company to place these machines pending the
clearance of this license application. At the regular meeting of the Board of City
		Commissioners held July 15, 1959, the application of the Nevada Vending Machine Co.,

Inc. was denied due to unfavorable police report.

Mr. Dickerson stated that Mr. Warne had a clear record and was presently licensed
with the County and the City of North Las Vegas as a vending machine operator and if
there were any questions, they would be glad to answer them.

His Honor Mayor Gragson asked if Mr. Warne was now the sole owner and Mr. Dickerson
replied that he was. Mr. Warne stated he had taken over the obligation of the corporation 
in the amount of $26,000 which was the sum presently owed to his creditors.

Mr. Warne stated further that he owed no money to the former corporation and there
was no one but himself connected with his application.

Commissioner Sharp stated that in view of the unfavorable police report because of the
former attempt to circumvent the City Ordinance in placing machines through another
vending operator, he thought this application should be held in abeyance so this report
could be gone over with the Police Department.

Mr. Dickerson said the placement of machines by the Smokey Cigarette Company were
made with the understanding they were to be retained by the Smokey Cigarette Company
if the license was not approved. Mr. Warne stated that at that time he was
negotiating to buy out this compary and when he learned their license was not valid
these arrangements had been made pending approval of their license by the City
Commission. He concluded he merely asked Mr. Eckl to fulfill the obligations and did
not realize or intend to circumvent the law.

Commissioner Sharp moved the application of Ralph T. Warne for a Cigarette Vending
Operator License at the Ralph T. Warne Vending Machine Company, 8 E. Charleston, be
held in abeyance pending investigation of the unfavorable police report; application
to again be considered at the regular meeting of the Board of City Commissioners to be
held October 7, 1959.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none.

REZONING (Z-24-59)	Commissioner Fountain moved the application of Home Investment Company of Long Beach

PUBLIC HEARING	This being the time heretofore set for public hearing in regard to the application of

Rezoning 2-9-58	D. N. Leavitt for reclassification of property located on the south side of West

D. N. Leavitt	Charleston Boulevard between Highland Drive and Desert Lane from R-1 and R-4 to C-2,

His Honor Mayor Gragson asked if there was anyone present who wished to speak in
Approved to	protest.

C-1 Zoning

Eric Schaefer, 1107 Desert Lane, stated he would like to protest this rezoning to C-2
as he felt it would not be beneficial to the residents or to the Presbyterian Church.

Marian Christensen stated that she lived on West Charleston and was neither protesting
or defending this particular application; however, a resolution had been presented to
the Planning Commission to the effect that if there was any rezoning in this area,
structures must conform to the present architecture.

9-16-59
Wilma Wilgar, 1111 Desert Lane, stated she had a nice home in this area and would
like to maintain it as a residence and would not care for this change in zoning.

Dr. D. N. Leavitt referred to a piano shop and nursery which was allowed here and
stated he did not believe it was right to deny another man the privilege of
developing a business on his property. He continued that this piece of property
was not suitable for a home and if the Commission saw fit to rezone it for the
purpose such as he proposed he could see no reason that it would hurt anyone. Dr.
Leavitt stated that he had no preliminary plans for the drive-in root beer stand
which he wishes to build at this location; however, he did have a picture of the
proposed structure. He stated he had paid a franchise for the product which will
be sold and he was required to build within one year.

Harry Cobb stated he owned property right next to Mr. Leavitt's and he was in favor
of approving this request for rezoning as he could not see how it would hurt any-
one. He added that his property was opposite the site in question and faced
Charleston and also Desert Lane.

Bob Harris, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the First Presbyterian Church,
informed the Board that they were considering a building program and that they
were concerned about what the freeway might take and what it might do to this
property.

Director of Public Works Sauer stated the plans for the interchange of the freeway 
at this location had not been finalized. Commissioner Sharp asked Dr.

Leavitt if he would still wish to build if the freeway should come through at this
location and he stated he would.

-0O0-

At the hour of 8:20 P. M. the meeting was recessed and reconvened at the hour of
8:40 P. M. with all members present as of the opening session.

-0O0-

His Honor Mayor Gragson stated they would continue with the hearing on Rezoning
Z-9-58. Commissioner Whipple stated this application was for a C-2 zoning and
perhaps that was extreme. He stated there was no question in his mind that this
property offered a real problem and that it was not suitable for a residence. As
far as the freeway was concerned if it should take part of this area it would
also take property of the protestants. Commissioner Whipple suggested a rezoning to C-1
as there was presently M-1, M-2, R-4. and R-E all around this property and the
applicant was unable to do anything with it under the present zoning.

Commissioner Whipple moved the application of D. N. Leavitt for reclassification of
property located on the south side of West Charleston Boulevard between Highland
Drive and Desert Lane be approved from R-1 and R-4 to C-1 and the City Attorney
instructed to prepare the necessary ordinance amendment.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Elwell and carried by the following vote:

Commissioner Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting
aye; noes, none. Commissioner Fountain stated that some three weeks ago the Mayor,
Director of Public Works and himself were in Carson City and at that time Mr. Ed Pine,
State Highway Engineer, informed them it would be a minimum of four years before the
freeway would reach this area.

-0O0-

At the hour of 8:30 P. M. Commissioner Fountain was excused from the meeting.

NO PARKING ZONE	Commissioner Sharp moved the recommendation of the Traffic and Parking Commission

Oakey Blvd.	for the installation of a no parking zone on both sides of Oakey Blvd. starting

at Las Vegas Blvd. South and extending east approximately 375' be approved; this
Approved	action would facilitate turning movements at the intersection.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:

Commissioners Elwell, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye; noes,
none. Absent: Commissioner Fountain.

REZONING (Z-18-59)	The Commission considered	the amended application of Baumgardner, Baumgardner and

Baumgardner, 	Hill for reclassification	of	property located on the west side of 14th	Street, ½

Baumgardner and Hill	block north of Fremont from R-3 to R-4.

	

Denied	The original application requested rezoning of only three lots owned by Baumgardner,

and the Planning Commission recommended denial; however, the Board of City 
Commissioners on August 3, 1959, held this application in abeyance and on August 19,

195, the City Commission referred it back to the Planning Commission with the
recommendation that serious consideration be given the rezoning of the surrounding
4-block area to R-4.

The Planning Commission conducted public hearing on September 10, 1959, and the
original applicants did not appear but prior to the hearing advised the Planning
Director that the property had been sold and they were no longer interested in the
rezoning. One neighboring property owner was present at the hearing and indicated that
R-3 was the proper zoning at this time. Denial was again recommended by the Planning
Commission on the grounds that the area was presently well-developed in R-3 garden-
type apartments, and there appeared to be no public need for reclassification.

Commissioner Sharp moved the amended application of Baumgardner, Baumgardner and Hill
for reclassification of property located on the west side of 14th Street, ½ block
north of Fremont from R-3 to R-4 be denied as recommended by the Planning Commission.

9-16-59
Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:

Commissioners Elwell, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none. Absent: Commissioner Fountain.

URBAN RENEWAL	Franklin Bills, Coordinator of Urban Renewal, asked the Mayor and Commissioners to

Code Assistance	read the report which had been given to each of them outlining the Code Assistance

Program	Program for preventing the spread of blight neighborhoods.

Mr. Bills continued that he had tried to point out in this report ways in which
each property owner by helping himself on his own property could help everybody to keep
Resolution	their property value stable. He added that it would make little sense to spend the

Adopted	taxpayers money in slum clearance programs, if at the same time, all steps were not

taken to keep other areas from slipping down-hill. This would entail a program that
will take years if it is to be equitable and legal as well as practical so that
everyone would be treated alike.

For this reason Mr. Bills requested the adoption of a resolution establishing the
priority areas for scheduled inspection and enforcement of building and safety codes
and rezoning ordinance; said resolution would adopt by reference a map outlining and
describing various areas with more critical districts given higher priorities.

Mr. Bills explained it was proposed to transfer someone from the Building Department
to do this work for the Planning Department. Whenever an inspection uncovered a 
non-compliance with any City Code which presented a fire hazard or menace to life, health
and property, remedial measures would be required within a reasonably short time; in
regard to minor violations which tend to have a down-grading effect on property over
a period of time and present no immediate menace, the property owner would be notified
and the deficiency recorded against the property in the County Recorder's Office. This
would require an ordinance change as the City did not have the authority to record
such notices.

Commissioner Whipple was of the opinion the property owners should be given ample time
to bring the structure tp to code and Mr. Bills assured him that reasonable consideration 
would be exercised in all instances. City Attorney Cory advised the time limit
would be set out in the ordinance and the resolution would express the desire of the
Commission for such a Code Assistance Program.

Commissioner Sharp moved the following resolution be adopted and order made:

A RESOLUTION ADOPTING AND DESIGNATING
THE PRIORITY FOR PROPERTY INSPECTIONS IN
A CODE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM DESIGNED AS A
PART OF A TOTAL URBAN RENEWAL PROGRAM TO
COMBAT BLIGHT AND BLIGHTING CONDITIONS

IN THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS____________

WHEREAS, the City of Las Vegas has undertaken a program of Urban Renewal; and
WHEREAS, evidence of the comprehensive nature of the City's program of Urban
Renewal is indicated by the adoption of a workable program to combat slums and blight
and blighting conditions in the City of Las Vegas which has been certified and twice
recertified by the Urban Renewal Division of the Housing and Home Finance Agency of the
United States Government; and

WHEREAS, plans to carry forth the clearance and redevelopment phase of this
program are indicated by the City of Las Vegas and by the United States Government
through the application for and approval of Planning Advance Loans to plan the clearance 
and redevelopment of the Madison School Urban Redevelopment Project; and

WHEREAS, the expenditure of public funds both local and federal, in the proposed
execution of an Urban Redevelopment Project or Projects in the City of Las Vegas
seems logical only if the Clearance and Redevelopment program is supplemented by
measures designed to prevent other areas of the city which are now standard add stable
from becoming deteriorated; and

WHEREAS, as a part of its "Workable Program" the City proposes a program of
assisting property owners to adhere to and conform to various city codes and
ordinances designed to protect the public and each individual against crime, vice,
disease, fire, and the deterioration of property and living conditions; and

WHEREAS, it appears neither logical, practical nor financially feasible for
the City of Las Vegas to retain sufficient qualified personnel to inspect every
property in the city at approximately the same time; and

WHEREAS, a more practical approach appears to require the scheduling of this
inspection and code assistance program by starting in the areas where city and other
public records indicate that obsolescence and deterioration have made the greatest
headway in order to forestall the further downgrading of properties and living
conditions, and if possible, upgrade these factors in these critical areas,

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Board of City Commissioners of the City
of Las Vegas does hereby adopt by reference a certain map prepared by the Urban
Renewal Division of the Planning Department entitled "Code Assistance Program Proposed
Priorities" dated September 1, 1959, outlining and describing the boundaries of
various areas within the City of Las Vegas and establishing the priority of each
described area for a scheduled inspection of properties for conformance with the
various city codes and ordinances designed to protect the public and each individual
against the menace of crime, vice, disease, fire and property deterioration; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the map establishing these priorities shall be
reviewed periodically and revised or amended as changing conditions may indicate for
such revision or amendment.

GARBAGE CONTRACT	Mayor Gragson opened the meeting regarding the transfer of the franchise for the

AGREEMENTS	City Garbage Contract from the Southern Nevada Disposal Service, Inc. to the Silver

State Disposal Company and asked Calvin Cory, City Attorney, to state to the gentlemen 
Transfer from	from the Southern Nevada Disposal Service, Inc. the desires of the City Commission.

Southern Nevada

Disposal Service,	Mr. Cory stated that as he understood it the Commission would probably have no 

Inc. to Silver	objection to the proposed transfer provided certain safeguards would be included and

State Disposal	become a part of the assignment to which the assignee would agree and which would become

Company	a part of the assignment; namely, that prior to the assignment the Commission would

be provided with a detailed statement of the equipment owned, and which would be
Resolution	owned, and maintained by the assignee.

Adopted

Tom Foley, Attorney representing the Southern Nevada Disposal Service, Inc., informed
the Board that he did not want to represent this equipment to be free and clear as
Max Chason was the legal owner until the indebtedness to him was paid off.

Mr. Cory continued further the Commission would like, before this assignment was
approved, to have a financial statement relative to the assets and liabilities of
Silver State Disposal Company both prior to the assignment and also immediately
after.

Mr. Foley stated the assets of this new company would be identical with the old
company, save and except the valuation of the franchise of the City of North Las
Vegas. Mr. Hibbs, Accountant for the Southern Nevada Disposal Service, Inc., explained
that the capital stock of the aforesaid company would be transferred to the Silver
State Disposal Company and certain assets would be taken into Silver State Disposal
Company.

Commissioner Whipple advised that they were concerned with the transfer of the
equipment and whether or not such equipment would be adequate to take care of the
garbage contract for the City of Las Vegas and if such equipment would be assigned
solely to the City of Las Vegas and not to the County or North Las Vegas, in the
event it would become necessary for the City to take over and keep the service 
continuing.

V. Gray Gubler, Attorney representing Max Chason, stated there would be no discontinuing 
of service as the agreement with Mr. Chason provided that he would take
over if a default was made. Mr. Gubler added his client had no objection to the transfer
subject to the condition that Max Chason would be shown as legal owner of this equipment 
until the indebtedness to him was satisfied.

Commissioner Fountain asked if there was ample equipment at this time to transfer
this equipment and give adequate service to the City of Las Vegas. Mr. Foley replied
they deemed it more than adequate and that two new trucks were being acquired next
Tuesday; further this equipment would be owned by the Silver State Disposal Company,
which company would be responsible for service in the City of Las Vegas.

Mr. Cory stated there was one other condition which he wished to mention regarding the
right of the City to disallow or disregard for rate-making purposes any increased
valuations resulting from said assignment or any expenditures which the City might
determine to be excessive or unnecessary.

Mr. Foley stated he felt the City already had that right as the Silver State
Disposal Company would be operating under the same contract but they were willing to
accept this condition. Mr. Hibbs stated he believed the rate setting was a power the
Commission had under ordinance however they might arrive at their conclusions for
the rates. Mr. Cory stated this was true and only the Commission could fix the rates;
however, it was the feeling this should be spelled out as there might be new 
stockholders who were unaware of this fact.

Commissioner Fountain said there should also be provision made for a certified audit
at least once a year, said audit to be certified by the firm making the audit. Mr.

Foley stated Clarence Hibbs of the Certified Public Accounting firm of Conway, Moe and
Hibbs, would actually be doing the work and setting up the books and making 
recommendations; therefore, this firm could not technically certify an audit performed by them.

Mr. Hibbs stated the procedure he contemplated, if the transfer was granted and they
were able to organize these companies, would entail considerable revamping of books and
his firm would make these determinations. He stated further that they hoped to see the
day when the company would handle its own firm accounting and they would then take the
position of independent auditors of the compary, however, this could not happen for
about a year after this transfer. Commissioner Whipple was of the opinion this could
be accomplished within a year.

Mayor Gragson stated that what the City wanted was for Mr. Hibbs' firm to state
that to the best of their knowledge and ability that such an audit was true and
correct.

Mr. Gubler requested, as representative of the encumbrance holder, that before
the assignment was finalized by the approval of the City Commission, he would like
to see these documents to protect his client, Max Chason.

9-29-59
Mr. Foley asked the Commission if they could, at this time, make the motion to
approve this transfer subject to the submission of the aforementioned information
and finding the same adequate, as it was the end of their fiscal year on
September 30, 1959, and they would like to get the income tax advantage.

Mayor Gragson asked City Attorney Cory if he felt this should be approved subject
to all the requirements the Commission felt necessary in order to make the
transfer. Mr. Cory replied that he thought it would be better to take action now
subject to such condition and if upon receipt of the requested information, the
Commission determined the assignee could not adequately provide service said
approval would be rescinded.

Merlin Jones, Accountant for the City, requested a written explanation of the
functions and operations of the related companies. Mr. Jones stated there were
at least four such companies; (1) Silver State Disposal Company which would
operate in the City of Las Vegas, (2) Disposal Transportation, Inc., which would
operate in the City of North Las Vegas, (3) Clark Sanitation, Inc., which would
operate in the County of Clark, and (4) Disposal Investments which would own the
land and buildings and operate a repair shop. He requested information as to
what would be the function of each company and what would be the transactions
between these companies and the Silver State Disposal Company; that is, the renting
of office space, renting of truck parking spaces and any maintenance of trucks.

Mr. Hibbs stated they could get this information and further that these rentals
back and forth would be discontinued. Mr. Foley said this information could be
supplied in a separate narrative.

Commissioner Fountain moved the following resolution be adopted and order made:

RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, has been
requested to approve the proposed transfer and assignment of that certain agreement
entered into between the said City and Southern Nevada Disposal Service, Inc., a
Nevada Corporation, dated the 4th day of January, 1956, together with that certain
agreement between said parties dated the 3rd day of June, 1959, to Silver State
Disposal Company, a Nevada Corporation, upon the express condition that the
following information shall be made available to the Board of Commissioners of the
City of Las Vegas for its consideration and review within a period of sixty (60)
days from the date hereof:

(a)	A detailed written explanation of the functions and operations of all
related companies doing business with the Silver State Disposal Company
together with a statement of all assets and liabilities of Silver State
Disposal Company and Southern Nevada Disposal Service, Inc., immediately
prior to, and immediately subsequent to, the proposed assignment.

(b)	A specification of equipment to be owned, leased or otherwise operated
by said company, which equipment shall in any event be not less than such
number and type of equipment as is necessary to adequately serve the City
of Las Vegas.

(c)	A statement of all encumbrances, if any, against said equipment, it
being understood that Max Chason, after said transfer of equipment to
Silver State Disposal Company, will be shown as legal owner of all said
equipment until such time as the indebtedness due Max Chason has been
satisfied in full by the Southern Nevada Disposal Service, Inc., or its
successors in interest.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that upon receipt of the foregoing information by
the City, the Board of Commissioners shall review the same and if it finds that the
proposed assignee will adequately perform the conditions and obligations of the
aforesaid agreements, the said City shall duly execute and deliver to Silver State
Disposal Company a written document consenting to the assignment as aforesaid, effective
the 1st day of October, 1959, provided that said assignment shall contain, among other
things, a provision acknowledging that the City of Las Vegas shall at all times have
the right to disallow or disregard for rate-making purposes increased valuations
resulting from said assignment as well as depreciation schedules, amortization
schedules, excessive salaries and other expenditures deemed unnecessary by said
Commission; and provided, further, that said assignment shall also contain a
condition requiring an annual certified audit of the books and records of account of
said company as of the close of business on the 30th day of September of each year,
which said certified audit shall be delivered to the City of Las Vegas not later
than the 15th day of December of each year, the first said certified audit to be
delivered on, or prior to, the 15th day of December, 1959; and further providing
that the Certified Public Accountant preparing said annual certified audit shall
also express his written opinion as to whether the financial statements present
fairly the financial position of the company and the results of its operations in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent
basis; and provided further, that said assignment shall contain a provision permitting 
an authorized representative of the City of Las Vegas to examine and
inspect the books of account and records of Silver State Disposal Company, and any
and all of its related companies at all reasonable times insofar as the operations of
said companies may affect the performance of the assigned agreements.

(CALL OF SPECIAL MEETING)

A special meeting of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, held
this 6th day of October, 1959;  was called to order at the hour 9:30 A.M. with the
following members present:

9-29-59 and 10-6-59
PERSONNEL	Administrative Assistant, Robert D. Heath, advised the Board that a list of candidates

DIRECTOR	who had applied for the position of Personnel Director had been submitted to them at

a special meeting held the morning of September 29, 1959, said list having outlined
Dr. John Montgomery              briefly the qualifications of each individual.

Appointed	At that time, Mr. Heath continued, the Personnel Department and the City Manager's

Office recommended the appointment of Franklin Dunlap as being the best qualified
applicant; however, the Board of City Commissioners requested Dr. John Montgomery be
interviewed by the Civil Service Board in regard to his qualifications and report to be
made back to them at a subsequent meeting. The Commissioners present at that time stated
they would prefer to delay action on this appointment until there were at least four
members present. A meeting was scheduled to be held at 3:30 that afternoon; however,
it was impossible to get a sufficient number present. Mr. Heath summarized that this
was the last official position of the matter and the way it had rested since that time.

Mr. Heath added that both of the above-mentioned candidates had now been interviewed
by the Civil Service Board and as a result preference was given to Franklin Dunlap,
the out-of-state candidate, as being the best qualified, and Mr. Heath stated Mr.

Dunlap was still his recommendation for the appointment.

Mayor Gragson stated he understood the Civil Service Board had interviewed both of
these gentlemen; however, only one of the five members of the Civil Service Board,
among others, was present at both interviews.

Mr. Heath stated that Ralston Hawkins, George Knipp and Charles Horsey interviewed
Mr. Dunlap; and that Don Ashworth and Charles Horsey interviewed Dr. Montgomery;
therefore, Mr. Horsey was the only member of the Civil Service Board who was in
attendance at both interviews. However, Mr. Heath stated this interviewing was
essentially a matter of courtesy on the part of the Civil Service Board, and the
recommendation for the appointment should come from the City Manager's Office.

Commissioner Elwell commented that he thought both Mr. Dunlap and Dr. Montgomery were
highly qualified men.

Mr. Heath stated he felt Mr. Dunlap was sufficiently qualified to do this job and that
he personally did not feel that Dr. Montgomery was and that he did not believe his
chiropractic background was sufficient qualification.

City Manager Kennedy stated he did not know about Dr. Montgomery being considered for
this appointment and he wondered if the Civil Service Board would be the proper
authority to make recommendation. He stated further that he had known Dr. Montgomery
for a long time and he would not recommend him for the Personnel Director position.

Commissioner Fountain stated that he most certainly appreciated Mr. Heath's 
recommendation and he disliked going against his recommendation; however, in view of the 
population of Southern Nevada, he felt they were hiring too many people from out of State.

He added that he appreciated the work Mr. Heath had done in regard to these prospective
candidates for this position, but that he would just have to be in favor of some local
man — not necessarily Dr. Montgomery. He was opposed to going out of town for this
appointment and stated they would get a lot of complaints about it. He added that no
doubt Mr. Dunlap would be very well-qualified.

His Honor Mayor Gragson stated that he would like to recommend at this time that they
hire Dr. Montgomery as Personnel Director as he felt he was qualified and that was the
reason he was making the recommendation.

Commissioner Elwell stated that he would favor a local man rather than going out of the
State as there would be too much criticism and in a city of 50,000 there should be a
qualified man for this post.

Commissioner Whipple stated that what had been said was substantially true, but that
sometimes local people could not be found for key positions inasmuch as they were not
interested; however, he agreed they did get a lot of criticism from tax payers by not
favoring local people whenever it was possible to do so.

Commissioner Fountain said that he would like to state that he did not know Dr.

Montgomery very well but that he had talked with him for an hour or two recently and
he felt that with his temperament and ability he should work out; however, he felt
there should be a probationary period. Mayor Gragson stated if Dr. Montgomery did not
prove satisfactory he would be the first to acknowledge this fact.

Commissioner Elwell moved Dr. John Montgomery be appointed to the position of Personnel
Director.

Mr. Heath apologized for interrupting but wished to indicate his belief that in view
of Mr. Kennedy's presence, a recommendation for appointment should come from him.

Mr. Kennedy stated that he had no recommendation to make at this time.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:

Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none. Commissioner Whipple qualified his vote with the statement that it be
understood by Dr. Montgomery that his appointment was probationary. Absent:

Commissioner Sharp.

CHARITABLE 	The Commission considered the application of the First Good Shepherd Lutheran Church

SOLICITATION PERMIT	to conduct a Christmas Card and Light Bulb Sale which had been disapproved by the

First Good Shepherd                        Solicitations Review Board.

Lutheran Church

Reverend Hoelter addressed the Commission stating this request actually came from
Application	the youth of his congregation for the purpose of raising funds to help pay the

Withdrawn	expense of attending a youth convention of the church. He stated further that the

Solicitations Review Board had disapproved this application on the basis that it was
for the benefit of a small group. Reverend Hoelter suggested there was a higher law
to be invoked and that was the law of encouraging youth to do something good.

His Honor Mayor Gragson pointed out the fact that the Lions Clubs had conducted their
annual light bulb sale in the past and if there were too many of the same type of drive
it would not be of any good to anyone, and he asked if there was some

other project they might use to raise funds. Reverend Hoelter agreed with the Mayor
on this point and stated that he would so advise them; however, he added that the
City of North Las Vegas had given permission for this sale and in anticipation of a
favorable reply from the City of Las Vegas, the light bulbs had been purchased.

Commissioner Fountain moved this application be denied as heretofore all charitable
solicitation permits had. been approved by the Solicitations Review Board and he could
not see why they should deviate from this procedure.

Mayor Gragson asked Mr. Cory, City Attorney, for an opinion in this regard, and Mr. Cory
stated he could see no reason why this application should be handled any differently
than any other. Commissioner Fountain stated he would uphold his motion in accordance
with the recommendation of the Solicitations Review Board. Commissioner Whipple suggested
this application be withdrawn as he would not approve it in view of the disapproval
of the Solicitations Review Board and he would have to be in favor of Commissioner
Fountain's motion.

Reverend Hoelter asked for time to confer with members of the youth council who were
present and later at this meeting he requested to withdraw the application at this
time and possible they would bring it before the Solicitations Review Board at a
later date.

Board.

George Dickerson, Attorney spoke in behalf of Mr. Warne, stating this application
had been held in abeyance; however, if anything was to be gained by a further
delay, he would not be opposed. Mr. Dickerson added it would be well if they could
be advised what the unfavorable report was based on. Commissioner Fountain replied
that he would refuse to divulge this information.

Commissioner Fountain moved the application of Ralph T. Warne for a Cigarette Vending

Mr. Dickerson later stated there were certain documents that were not before the

to forbid any evidence they might have. Mr. Dickerson made further reference to
the affidavits showing Mr. Warne as the only one interested in this company. He
also stated Mr. Warne would make available future income tax reports to support
this fact; furthermore, that the returns of the members of the former corporation

REZONING (Z-21-59)	The Commission considered the application of Wilbur Clark for the reclassification

Wilbur Clark	of all of Lot 1 and Portions of Lots 19 and 20; Block 21; Twin Lakes Village Unit

#5; from R-1 to C-1. Approval was recommended by the Planning Commission on the
Approved	basis that due to existing development and the characteristics of this particular

parcel; it did not appear that it would be suitable for residential uses.

Planning Director Bills stated two public hearings were held by the Planning
Commission and there were a number of protests; three of them written. Mr. Bills
stated further there was mention of the fact that the applicant intended to construct
a filling station at this location; however; this would require approval  of a use
permit by the Board of Zoning Adjustment as well as the City Commission.

Herbert Jones, Attorney representing the applicant; stated it was intended to make
application for a use permit to allow a filling station. Commissioner Whipple was
of the opinion there would be a terrific amount of opposition to this and that he
would be opposed also to such a development. Mr. Jones added that before anything
could be developed on this property it would have to be rezoned to commercial.

Commissioner Fountain moved the application of Wilbur Clark for the reclassification
of all of Lot 1 and portions of Lots 19 and 20; Block 21; Twin Lakes Village Unit
#5; from R-1 to C-1 be approved with the understanding that before a filling station
could be put on this property a Use Permit application would have to come before
the Board of Zoning Adjustment and the City Commission; and further that the City
Attorney be instructed to prepare the necessary ordinance amendment.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Elwell and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell; Fountain; Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noeS; none. Absent:	Commissioner Sharp.

REZONING (Z-25-59)	The Commission considered the application of Commissioner E. W. Fountain for the

E. W. Fountain	reclassification of Lot 1; Block 1-A; Twin Lakes Village Unit 1 Addition; from

R-1 to R-4. Denial was recommended by the Planning Commission.

Denied

Commissioner Fountain read the following letter which he had written to the Mayor
and Commissioners in regard to this application:

October 7, 1959

Honorable Mayor Oran K. Gragson
Commissioner Reed Whipple
Commissioner Harris P. Sharp
Commissioner Wm. H. Elwell

Honorable Sirs:

On September 22, 1959, by a 5 to 3 vote; the Planning Commission
decided to disapprove this application.

While I do not agree with the action taken by the Planning 
Commission on denying this application; I am declaring my interest
in this matter for the purpose of the record and I; of course;
will withhold my vote.

Secondly; I request that the Planning Commission's recommendation
of disapproval be followed by the Board of Commissioners at this
time; with the understanding that such action will not prejudice
my right to resubmit this matter for consideration at a later
date.

Respectfully submitted;

EWF/c	E. W. Fountain

cc - George M. Dickerson; Esq.

cc - Franklin J. Bills; Director of Planning

cc - Al Cahlan; Chairman; Planning Commission

10-7-59
Commissioner Elwell moved the application of Commissioner E. W. Fountain for the
reclassification of Lot 1, Block 1-A; Twin Lakes Village Unit 1 Addition from
R-1 to R-4 he denied as recommended by the Planning Commission and Commissioner
Fountain's letter be filed as a matter of record.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell; Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye; noes; none.
Commissioner Fountain passed his vote. Absent:	Commissioner Sharp.

REZONING (Z-27-59)	The Commission considered the application of the Mesquite Club; Inc. for the

Mesquite Club; Inc.                                          reclassification of property located on the west side of Maryland Parkway south

of St. Louis from R-1 to R-4.

Approved

This property was acquired by the Mesquite Club for the purpose of a site for
their new clubhouse and a use permit was granted on the basis that the Mesquite
Club constituted a quasi-public use and therefore permitted in a residential
area. Planning Director Bills stated it was now the intention of the Mesquite
Club to sell the property and the prospective purchasers intended to locate an
intensified complex of professional offices on the property.

The Planning Commission; after two hearings; recommended denial of this
application on the basis that if this particular area was rezoned; it would only
serve to open the door for a more intensive type of development all along
Maryland Parkway. At the first meeting there were two expressions of objection;
however; one was later withdrawn because this particular objector; who is a
property owner in the near vicinity; felt that if the Mesquite Club was granted
this rezoning it would then make it possible for him to have his property rezoned.

Commissioner Fountain stated he would like to see the artist's conception of the
area. Mr. Bills stated that until such time as the zoning was changed they would
not have it before them.

Commissioner Fountain added he did not agree with the Planning Commission's
recommendation and moved the application of the Mesquite Club; Inc. for
reclassification of property located on the west side of Maryland Parkway
south of St. Louis from R-1 to R-4 be approved; and the City Attorney instructed
to prepare the necessary ordinance amendment.

His Honor Mayor Gragson asked if there was anyone present who wished to speak in
regard to this rezoning; and a Dr. Jones stated he was one of the physicians
interested in erecting a building at this location. He added they had made a
survey of the residents in this area and had found no one; who disapproved a
medical facility there; furthermore; in looking over the property; it would appear
if it was to remain R-1 there would not be eager buyers as there would be 200' of
backyard to keep up or ignore. Dr. Jones was of the opinion it would not be
agreeable to continue this zoning as R-1. He concluded that; speaking for the
doctors; it seemed a rezoning to permit them to build a medical center at this
location would in no way jeopardize the area.

Commissioner Whipple asked if there was anyone who wished to protest this 
application and there was no response.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Elwell and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell; Fountain; Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noeS; none. Absent:	Commissioner Sharp. Commissioner Whipple qualified his

"aye" vote with the statement that in the past they had had a verbal agreement
with the Planning Commission that when they disagreed with them a joint meeting
would be held between the City Commission and the Planning Commission and out
of courtesy he believed this should be done.

Commissioner Fountain stated he would like it spread on the minutes that there might
have been a rumor as to his participation in this operation and he wished to explain
that sometime between 1956 and 1957 his wife had been President of the Mesquite Club;
however; at the present time she was not the President nor was she a member of the
Board of Trustees — she was just a member of the Mesquite Club. Commissioner
Fountain added he appreciated the work of the Planning Commission in working out this
area but in this particular instance he did not agree.

USE PERMIT	The Commission considered the application of Hotel Sahara; Prewin; Inc.; for a Use

U-22-59	Permit to conduct a semi-public parking lot for a period of one year at the

northwest corner of San Francisco and Paradise Road; legally described as Lot 10;
Hotel Sahara;	Block 3; South Fifth Street Tract #1; in an R-4 zone. Approval was recommended by

Prewin; Inc.	the Board of Zoning Adjustment subject to certain conditions.

Approved	Director of Planning Bills stated certain points had been brought up at staff meeting

and it had been recommended this application be referred to the Traffic and Parking
Commission for study of questions within its jurisdiction. Commissioner Whipple
asked if there was any real problem that could not be worked out and if the applicant
had been advised of this.

Herbert Jones; Attorney representing the applicant; stated they had not been informed
of this and he would like to have permission to get with this Commission to know what
the problems were as his client had always worked with them.

Commissioner Whipple moved the application of Hotel Sahara; Prewin; Inc.; for a Use
Permit to conduct a semi-public parking lot for a period of one year at the northwest 
corner of San Francisco and Paradise Road; legally described as Lot 10; Block
3; South Fifth Street Tract #1; in an R-4 zone; be approved subject to the following
conditions as recommended by the Board of Zoning Adjustment; with the stipulation
that the applicant consult with the Traffic and Parking Commission in regard to
the traffic and pedestrian situation:

1.	Conformance to the Plot Plan.

2.	Signing of an improvement agreement and filing of a bond to cover
the offsite improvements as recommended by the Department of Public

10-7-59
Works, excepting the ½ alley paving.

3. That the permit he for a period of time not to
exceed one year from the date of approval.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none. Absent:	Commissioner Sharp.

USE PERMIT	The Commission considered the application of Lawrence G. McNeil Company, a

U-23-59	California Corporation, to construct a church building at the northeast corner

of Cashman Drive and West Oakey Boulevard, legally described as a tract of
Lawrence G. McNeil	land in the Southwest corner of the SE¼, NW¼, Section 5; T21S, R61E, measuring

Co.	300 feet north and south and 330 feet east and west with Cashman Drive as the

west boundary and Oakey Boulevard as the south boundary in an R-1 zone.

Held in Abeyance	Approval was recommended by the Board of Zoning Adjustment subject to certain

conditions. Mr. Bills stated that it was proposed to construct a Greek
Orthodox Church at this location.

Commissioner Elwell asked if there was anyone present who wished to protest
this application and Jack Belcher, Architect, 1330 Cashman Drive, stated he
owned property to the north and contended this development would be injurious
to the value of the property; however, his main reason for objecting was the
hazard to the children in the area as a result of the increased traffic.

Alex Shoofey, 1300 Cashman Drive, spoke to the Commission stating he represented
several neighbors that were not able to be present and mentioned one as being
David Boyer, and that they had discussed the possibility of perhaps making the
church people an offer for this property and further to assist them in finding
another location. Mr. Shoofey requested this application be held in abeyance
to give them the opportunity to get together with the church board.

Commissioner Fountain stated he did not believe there were enough protests to
prevent the church from going into this area and moved this application be held
in abeyance until the next regular meeting of the Board of City Commissioners
to be held October 21, 1959, in order that the representatives of the church
might meet with the neighboring people to resolve their differences in regard
to the construction of a church at this location.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Elwell and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none. Absent:	Commissioner Sharp.

His Honor Mayor Gragson suggested this meeting be arranged at the earliest
possible date in order that further consideration of this application might
not be unnecessarily delayed.

Joseph Wright, Accountant, 1926 Houston Drive, spoke on behalf of the applicant
and advised the Commission considerable effort had been made to find a suitable
location and this was the only piece of property which they found that they
could handle and which was located in an area where they would not encroach on
their neighbor's rights or endanger children. He added there was nothing at all
to the south of this property nor for a great distance to the east and north.

Commissioner Fountain again stated he did not believe there were enough protests
to the church in this area, but he felt in view of Mr. Shoofey's statement the
neighboring people should be entitled to this meeting with the church board.

At the hour of 8:35 P.M. this meeting was recessed and reconvened at the hour
of 9:00 P.M. with all members present as of the opening session.

3rd & Charleston	Parking Commission for approval of two 40' curb openings on the north side

of Charleston Boulevard from 3rd Street east 158' as requested by E. R.

Approved	Herbst. Mr. Bills advised that under existing ordinance three 32' curb cuts

would be allowable; however, in this instance it was recommended the two 40'
curb openings be allowed as the number of openings would be reduced.

Commissioner Fountain moved the two 40' curb openings on the north side of
Charleston Boulevard from 3rd Street east 158' be approved as recommended
by the Traffic and Parking Commission.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:

URBAN RENEWAL	Coordinator of Urban Renewal, Franklin J. Bills, advised the Commission that

"PROJECT	"Project Industrial" had been originally planned as the City's first redevelopment

INDUSTRIAL"	 project in the Westside area, and a complete application for planning funds

and the reservation of capital grant funds had been previously submitted as
Resolution Adopted	approved by the City Commission. Due to the application of a formula adopted by

the Urban Renewal Administration, this project was temporarily shelved inasmuch
as the estimated capital grant funds necessary for this project exceeded the funds
allocated to the City of Las Vegas.

Mr. Bills requested adoption of a proposed resolution which had been approved by the
Urban Renewal Advisory Committee and by the City Planning Commission. He stated
further that the adoption of this resolution would authorize him, as Coordinator
of Urban Renewal, to refile this application for survey and planning for "Project
Industrial." together with supporting documents with the Housing and Home Finance
Agency. This application could be considered only at such time in the future as
Federal Funds again become available. Mr. Bills also stated the new housing
legislation would possibly increase the ceiling on capital grant funds available
to the City of Las Vegas.

Commissioner Fountain moved the following resolution be adopted and order made:

A RESOLUTION REQUESTING THAT THE APPLICATION FOR SURVEY
AND PLANNING FOR PROJECT INDUSTRIAL BE REFILED WITH THE
HOUSING AND HOME FINANCE AGENCY ON A STANDBY BASIS.

WHEREAS, the city of Las Vegas did at the direction of the Housing and Home
Finance Agency execute a Feasibility Survey at the expense of over $19,000.00 of
which $16,654.00 was a federal advance; and

WHEREAS, as a result of this Feasibility Survey it was determined that the
best course of action for the City of Las Vegas was to file on Application for
Survey and Planning for Project Industrial and said Application for Survey and
Planning and a subsequent Eligibility and Relocation Report was submitted to the
Housing and Home Finance Agency; and

WHEREAS, on September 9, 1958, the Housing and Home Finance Agency did
establish a formula placing a fiscal year ceiling on capital grant authority
available to a locality; and

WHEREAS, as a result of this formula project Industrial was determined to
be in excess of the ceiling and would not be permitted in it's original, form; and

WHEREAS, the Housing and Home Finance Agency did permit an Application for
Survey and Planning for an alternate project; and

WHEREAS, an Application for Survey and Planning for the Madison School Project
was filed and said project is now in the planning stages; and

WHEREAS, the Housing and Home Finance Agency permits a locality to file an
Application for Survey and Planning which would exceed the present fiscal year
ceiling on a standby basis for future consideration when federal funds become
available; and

WHEREAS, the United States Congress has enacted an Omnibus Housing Bill that
would make these federal funds available;

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of City Commissioners of the City
of Las Vegas that the original Application for Survey and Planning for Project
Industrial be refiled and;

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Eligibility and Relocation Report for Project
Industrial be refiled and;

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the documents be refiled with the statement that
in view of the present limitations on available capital grant authority the Local
Public Agency desires to have the Application and the Report held in a standby
status by the Housing and Home Finance Agency until such time as further consideration 
is possible, and/or the present fiscal year ceiling is raised.

Moved, Approved and Adopted this 7th day of October, 1959.

Attest:	ORAN K. GRAGSON, Mayor

MARJORIE HOLTSCHLAG, City Clerk

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none. Absent:	Commissioner Sharp.

URBAN RENEWAL	Planning Director Bills requested the adoption of a general neighborhood plan

covering the area between the Union Pacific Railroad and Highland, West Bonanza
General Neighborhood 	Road and the north City Limits; said plan being in harmony with the City Master

Renewal Plan	Plan and providing some refinements to the General Master Plan. Mr. Bills added

this was a necessary and valuable step in the preparation of complete final
Adopted	detailed planning for the Madison School Redevelopment Project. He stated this

plan proposed a somewhat different line of the freeway through the Westside School
and Westside Recreation Area and he felt this was a method by which they could
solidify their position on this with the State Highway Dept.

Commissioner Fountain stated in his opinion the freeway in this particular area was
five years away and asked how this would affect any rezoning for this year and the
following year. Mr. Bills stated it would have the same general effect the Master
Plan might have and that on zoning items the particular circumstances must be taken
into consideration.

Commissioner Fountain stated he would not agree if any restriction was to be put
on property owners in this right-of-way as they had to protect those people. Mayor

10-7-59
Gragson asked if the proposed freeway would affect the zoning in that area. Mr.
Bills replied that he did not see how it possibly could until the Highway Department
came up with a final plan. Commissioner Fountain stated if this was spelled out,
he would support the plan and he appreciated the fact that these maps were necessary;
however, it was a question of protecting the people in this right-of-way which was
five years away.

Commissioner Elwell moved the general neighborhood plan covering the area between
the Union Pacific Railroad and Highland, West Bonanza Rd. and the north City Limits
be adopted.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none. Absent:	Commissioner Sharp.

Commissioner Fountain asked that the question regarding the rezoning be worked
out with the City Attorney as to what could be expected in this particular area
inasmuch as it was not known if the freeway would be located there or not. Mr.

Cory stated this was only the adoption of a general neighborhood plan which would
be used by Mr. Bills for his guidance and it did not constitute a change of
zoning in this area. Mr. Cory added that any change of zoning by property
owners would still come in for the next five years according to present ordinance.

BID NO. 59.60	Commissioner Fountain moved Bid No. 59.60 for the Painting of Exteriors at Dula

Paint Exteriors;	Recreation Center Building and Swimming Pool Building be awarded to the Sharpe's

Dula Recreation	Paint Company, 24 W. Utah, for the low bid in the amount of $4,257; engineer's

Center & Swimming	estimate was $4,000.

LIQUOR LICENSE	The Commission considered the request of Cecil Lynch, doing business as the

Change of	Fortune Club, 22 Fremont, to change from a tavern operation to a package

Operation	operation under a Tavern License. This request was held in abeyance for a full

Board at the last regular meeting held October 7, 1959.

Fortune Club

Cecil Lynch stated the Fortune Club had been closed for about ten days and he
Approved	felt this change of operation would enable him to continue in his business on

a paying basis. Commissioner Elwell stated that under a Tavern License,
ordinance allows the sale of package goods. Mr. Lynch answered that he was
aware of this but it had been the policy of the Board that under a Tavern
License the primary business would be for on-premise consumption.

In view of the applicant's statement, Commissioner Fountain moved the request of
Cecil Lynch, doing business as the Fortune Club, 22 Fremont, to change from a
tavern operation to a package operation under a Tavern License be approved
subject to this license not being transferred to another location.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson
voting aye; noes, none.

REZONING Z-26-59	The Commission considered the application of Thomas T. Beam for the reclassification 

of property generally described as the southwest corner of Bonanza
Held in Abeyance	and 25th Street from R-1 and R-3 to C-1.

Denial had been recommended by the Planning Commission on the basis that this
would be an act of spot zoning and would only serve to open the door for further
spot zoning on the several existing vacant corner properties along 25th Street.
There were two protests to this application at the Planning Commission hearing.
Three prior applications for commercial zoning on 25th Street were previously
denied.

D.   Francis Horsey, Attorney representing the applicant, spoke to the Commission
in regard to this rezoning and traced briefly the three meetings of the Planning
Commission at which this application was considered. He added the impression
had been given at the last meeting that had this application been made for
rezoning of the entire block it might have received favorable consideration.

Mr. Horsey stated further that there was commercial zoning right across the
street and that the two protestants resided over 600' from the property in
question.

The applicant, Thomas Beam, advised the Commission that in 1952 when this area
was zoned R-3, it was not possible for him to develop his property, due to
circumstances beyond his control. He was of the opinion it would not be practical
to construct a dwelling on such a corner and mentioned the fact there were two
major thoroughfares there and no gas station within a mile in either direction.

He felt he had requested this rezoning in good faith and possibly this was the
ultimate use for this property and he did not believe his application should
necessarily be put aside until a complete design for further commercial
development in this presently undeveloped block could be submitted.

Commissioner Sharp moved the application of Thomas T. Beam for the reclassification 
of property generally described as the southwest corner of Bonanza
and 25th Street from R-1 and R-3 to C-1, be held in abeyance to be discussed
further at a meeting between the Planning Commission and the City Commission
at 10:00 A.M., October 27, 1959.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson
voting aye; noes, none.

USE PERMIT U-23-59	Commissioner Fountain moved the application of Lawrence G. McNeil Company, a

Lawrence G. McNeil	California Corporation, to construct a church building at the northeast corner

Company	of Cashman Drive and West Oakey Boulevard, legally described as a tract of land

in the southwest corner of the SE¼, NW¼, Section 5; T21S, R61E, measuring 300''
Approved	north and south, and 330' east and west, with Cashman Drive as the west boundary

and Oakey Boulevard as the south boundary in an R-1 zone be approved as
recommended by the Board of Zoning Adjustment, subject to the following
conditions:

1.	Conformance to the plot plan as submitted but including the installation of
only the required amount of off-street parking space to be hard-surfaced.

2.	Signing of an improvement agreement and filing of a bond to cover the cost of
offsite improvements for half street improvements along Cashman Drive.

3.       That the church agree to enter into an assessment district for the installation 
of improvements on West Oakey when such a district is formed, or when
improvements put in on S½ of Oakey.

4.       Dedication of 10' of right-of-way on the north side of Oakey Blvd. which
is the additional right-of-way needed to conform with the Master Plan of
Streets and Highways.

5.      Dedication of 26' of right-of-way along the east side of Cashman Drive which
is that right-of-way needed for a 51' street.

MINUTES	Las Vegas, Nevada

November 4, 1959

A regular meeting of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas,

Nevada, held this 4th day of November, 1959, was called to order at the hour
of 7:30 P.M. with the following members present:

Mayor	Oran K. Gragson

Commissioner	William H. Elwell

Commissioner	Harris P. Sharp

Commissioner	Reed Whipple

City Manager	A. H. Kennedy

VARIANCE V-16-59	The Commission considered the application of Jack E. Schieff for a variance to

Jack E. Schieff	allow a reduction in the number of onsite parking spaces for 24 units from

24 spaces to 6 spaces, to be compensated by other off street parking in the
Held in Abeyance	immediate area, located at 309 N. 1st Street, between Stewart Avenue and

Police Headquarters, legally described as Lots 21 and 22, Block 1, Parkview
Addition, in an R-4 zone.

10-23-59 and 11-4-59
Denial was recommended "by the Board of Zoning Adjustment on the basis of insufficient
parking; the applicant's proposal of auxiliary parking was disregarded as being
impractical. There were no protests. Director of Planning, Franklin Bills, advised
the Commission a similar application had been presented to them a year or so
ago and was denied because this property appeared likely to be in the path of a
tentative ramp to the freeway. He believed the Zoning Board wished to be reasonable 
about parking in the downtown area but that 6 parking spaces in lieu of 24
could hardly be considered favorably. Mr. Bills added that the Board of City
Commissioners could waive a portion of this parking on presentation of evidence
of adequate parking.

Mr. Schieff addressed the Commission, stating there were presently parking lots
at 2nd Street and Stewart and 1st Street and Stewart, which were only a couple
of hundred feet away, as well as parking spaces available at two gasoline
stations which front on Main Street. He stated he could make arrangements for
additional parking at these lots; furthermore, many of his tenants lived close
to town because they do not have cars and would have no need for parking.

Commissioner Sharp asked if Mr. Schieff had a lease with the owners of the parking
lots and Mr. Schieff said he could get a written agreement whereby this parking
would be provided at a special price. He added that the Town House Hotel, which
he owned, had 48 rooms and 12 parking spaces and the only time any parking
difficulty was experienced was on week-ends when rooms were rented to tourists.

Commissioner Elwell asked him if he planned to rent to permanent residents mostly,
and Mr. Schieff replied in the affirmative. Commissioner Sharp believed there
was some merit in Mr. Schieff's proposal, but believed 6 spaces was a little
shy for 24 apartments, unless lease agreements could be presented, guaranteeing
adequate parking.

City Attorney Cory was of the opinion such an agreement should be for a period
of ten years; furthermore, he requested the applicant to confer with him in
regard to other pertinent details which the City would require in said agreements.

Commissioner Sharp moved the application of Jack E. Schieff for a variance to
allow a reduction in the number of onsite parking spaces for 24 units from 24
spaces to 6 spaces, to be compensated by other off-street parking in the immediate
area, located at 309 N. 1st Street, be held in abeyance, so that the parking
lot agreements could be worked out with the City Attorney.

property was located almost adjacent to the "Madison School" Project area;
furthermore; the property was too small and the existing buildings were nonconforming.

of Public Works Sauer advised there was a half-alley involved and it would 
possibly be five years before such an improvement would be required.

Referred to Board of	Industrial Road and Fairfield, legally described as Lots 18 and 19, Block 13,

Zoning Adjustment	Meadows Addition, in an R-4 zone.

Approval of this application was recommended by the Board of Zoning Adjustment,
subject to certain conditions. Planning Director Bills advised the Board of
Zoning Adjustment was guided in their recommendation by the location of this
property, which was the last parcel zoned R-4 and was adjacent to industrial
zoning. He added there were two present at the hearing in protest and three
letters of protest.

Mr. William D. Cooper, 236 W. Boston, addressed the Commission and presented a
petition of 20 people who were opposed to this school at this location. He
further advised the Commissi on that he had just been informed that Mrs. Howard's
property had been sold to a Mr. Carliss about 2½ weeks ago -- having received
this information from Mr. Carliss himself. He also stated this new owner was
unable to be at this meeting tonight, but he had told him he would like to see
this application denied.

Frederika Singer stated that of her present five students, three of them took
their lessons in their homes; furthermore, the lessons would be given later in
the day, due to the fact the children were in school. Commissioner Whipple said
if this application was approved as submitted, she would be able to have more
students, and Miss Singer agreed with this; however, she advised many would be
taught in their own homes.

Planning Director Bills stated that when this application was approved by the
Board of Zoning Adjustment, he was sure they did not realize the number of
protestants, and, certainly, the question of ownership of this property was not
given to this Board in any form; therefore, he requested this matter be
referred back to the Board of Zoning Adjustment.

Commissioner Whipple moved the application of Mrs. Vern Howard for a use permit
to allow Frederika M. Singer to conduct a private music school at 242 Boston
Avenue be referred back to the Board of Zoning Adjustment.

Denied	meeting of the Board of City Commissioners held October 23, 1959, and at a joint

meeting of the Board of City Commissioners and the Planning Commission held
October 27, 1959, the Planning Commission again recommended denial of this

FLOOD CONTROL PLAN	His Honor Mayor Gragson stated, the City of Las Vegas was well aware of the need.

for adequate flood control and was willing and ready to participate with the
Discussion	County and other agencies to bring this about; however, the City could not do

it on their own. He added the City had been instrumental in getting a Flood
Control Board appointed by the County, with the former Mayor, C. D. Baker, as
Chairman, and this Board was now working on the over-all plan. His Honor
introduced Richard P. Sauer, Director of Public Works, in regard to an alternate
plan the City had in regard to flood control.

Mr. Sauer stated that as a temporary expedient, until such time as the Flood
Control Board decided on an over-all plan, it was proposed to strengthen the
present berm from Charleston to San Francisco, allowing a small outlet at
Charleston, detaining part of the water in the gravel pit and the overflow to be
channeled down San Francisco. He continued it was further proposed to present
this over-all plan, as outlined above, to the Flood Control Board immediately
upon the return of C. D. Baker, Chairman of the Flood Control Committee, about
November 12, 1959.

Mr. Sauer told those people interested that he would be very happy to go over
this proposal with them after this meeting, or at their convenience. One lady
present requested compensation for property damage caused by four breaks in
the dyke, and City Attorney Cory advised a claim should be filed on forms which
could be obtained from the City Clerk; however, he pointed out this damage
occurred in the County. Those present contended the damage occurred due to the
inadequacy of the City ditch.

Mayor Gragson asked if any of them proposed the dyke be done away with 
completely, and they were of the opinion it would be better to have it done
away with unless this proposal could be worked out, inasmuch as the flooding
had been worse since it had been put in. Mr. E. D. Oetter asked if their
group could have a representative at the meeting of the Flood Control Committee
and was told they could and that they would be informed as to when such meeting
would be held.

SERVICE LEAGUE &	Director of Public Works Sauer presented the drawing prepared by the Engineering

ART LEAGUE	Department, designating certain areas at Lions Club Park for development by the

Service League and the Art League, said drawing being a revision of proposals
Proposed Developments; 	by these agencies and which met their approval.

Lions Club

Park	Commissioner Sharp moved this drawing be approved and City Attorney instructed to

prepare appropriate resolutions, putting the City on record for these uses,
Approved	subject to the prior right of the public to use the property; said resolutions

Resolution to be	to be presented to the Board of City Commissioners for adoption at their next

Prepared	regular meeting, to be held November 18, 1959.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none. Absent:	Commissioner Fountain.

SEWAGE SYSTEM	Director of Public Works Sauer presented the request of Mr. M. A. Schneider,

HOOKUP RATES;	owner of the shopping center at corner of Arville and Charleston, which was in

REFUNDS	the County and not presently hooked up to City Sewer, wherein he would like to

have the Board of City Commissioners consider a refund for the difference in the
Held In Abeyance	rates charged within the City and outside the City, if and when this property

should become annexed to the City. Mr. Sauer stated the City Attorney and
Director of Finance recommended if such an agreement was approved by the City
Commission, that a time limit of two years be set for such a refund.

Commissioner Sharp doubted the feasibility of such a request, inasmuch as the
City had granted the privilege to connect into the City Sewer in the first
place. City Attorney Cory stated it would be a matter of policy on the part of
the Commission. He added that subdividers in like situations constructed the
sewers and then donated them to the City.

City Manager Kennedy stated there were other property owners involved in
similar instances where the City had granted them the right to connect into the
City Sewer and was of the opinion this matter should be given further study.

Commissioner Sharp moved this matter be held in abeyance.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
noes, none. Absent:	Commissioner Fountain.

EFFLUENT WATER	Director of Public Works Sauer reported the situation regarding the effluent

Sale of	waters had been discussed with the Engineering Consultant, Mr. John A. Carollo

and the City Attorney; however, repeated calls to the Soil Conservation Service
Policy Adopted	had been without results. Mr. Sauer continued that, as a result of these

discussions, it was recommended the effluent waters be sold to private consumers
 for the purpose of crop irrigation, to be predicated on the following
stipulations:

1.	The water be sold to those users only in the amount required for the land
that they own.

2.	Any structures constructed by the users on City-owned land, or right-of-
way, for pumping or diverting these waters, be subject to the approval of
the City.

3.	That the water be sold on a contract for 5 years and the City to have the

right to cancel at any time; however, at the end of five years, any change

of price for the water shall be based on similar prices to those in effect

in other cities selling effluent waters.	Furthermore, at the end of five

years that the advisability of extending the lease period to be investigated
 and that any agreement shall be approved by the Public Service Commission.

11-4-59
4. That the price for acre foot of water he set at $2,00, based on similar
conditions in Tucson, as well as the Fallon Irrigation District.

Mr. Sauer added that this recommendation was based on the present available
water of ten million gallons per day. On the basis of five acre foot per
year, required for the irrigation of alfalfa, this would irrigate 2,250
acres of land a year, It was estimated that there was less than 500 acres
in the immediate vicinity of the effluent ditch that could be irrigated at
the present time and it was questioned whether more than this could be
irrigated economically. Mr. Sauer stated that, in addition to the requests of
private developers for the purchase of these waters, the Power Company had
submitted a letter indicating a desire to be considered for its use in the
expansion of their power system.

Lalif Wood could not see the need for the time limit of 5 years and City
Attorney Cory explained certain circumstances might arise whereby such a time
limit would be necessary. Commissioner Whipple stated he understood the
renegotiating would be more as to price and not as to the use of the water,
in the event the City would have to spend money to increase plant facilities.
Commissioner Whipple added that from what had been said, there was more
effluent water available than there was land to irrigate. The Commissioners
expressed the opinion this water should be sold and put to use and not wasted.

Commissioner Elwell moved the recommendation of Director of Public Works
be approved and the following resolution be adopted and order made:

RESOLUTION

RESOLVED that the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas hereby
declares its intention to sell effluent water which may be available from
time to time from its Sewage Disposal Plant to applicants therefor, on terms
and conditions to be drafted by the City Attorney and presented to the Board
of Commissioners at the next regular meeting.

PASSED, ADOPTED AND APPROVED this 4th day of November, 1959.

existing dedicated streets for which public hearing was set by the City Commission
for 7:30 P.M., December 2, 1959. Approval was recommended by the Planning

includes Block 1, Fremont Addition to the City of Las Vegas, from R-1 to R-3.

Denied

Director of Planning Bills stated there was considerable evidence presented
at the Planning Commission hearing, indicating that Mr. Adelson was not the
legal owner of the property at this time; the apparent legal owner, Dr. Levon
Kassabian, of Los Angeles, was included among the objectors of record. Denial
was recommended by the Planning Commission, regardless of the ownership of the
property, on the grounds that it was completely out of harmony with the land use
section of the proposed Master Plan. There were 15 protestants of record at
the Planning Commission hearing and 2 persons in favor.

Mr. Bills advised that he had received a phone call from Mr. Adelson that
afternoon, requesting him to present an apology to the Commission for his
misunderstanding in making this application at a time when this property was
in escrow and that he had no further interest in having it rezoned. (At this
point a gentleman presented a petition in protest, consisting of 225 signatures,
to be filed as part of the record.)

Commissioner Elwell moved the application of Merv Adelson for the reclassification
of property legally described as the N½, SW¼, SW¼, Section 2, T21S, R61E, which

described as being bounded by Madison Avenue, "N" Street, Jefferson Avenue and
Denied	Highland Drive, from RE to R-1.

Denial was recommended by the Planning Commission on the basis that this zoning
would violate the provisions of a policy and plan approved by the Planning
Commission and the Board of City Commissioners, which stipulated that property
lying between "N" Street and Highland Drive would remain zoned RE. A protest
was presented at the Planning Commission hearing on behalf of the Bonanza
Village Home Owners' Association.

William Bailey addressed the Commission, stating that he was not in town when
this item was brought before the Planning Commission, and asked that this
application be referred back to that Board for reconsideration and to hear his
arguments in favor of this proposed rezoning; namely, the replacing of displaced
persons as a result of the freeway program and the feasibility of such zoning
adjacent to the Urban Renewal Area.

Commissioner Elwell moved this application be referred back to the Planning
Commission.

Mayor Gragson asked if there was anyone present who wished to be heard in protest
to this rezoning and Mrs. Longo stated this was a well-established plan and
people had bought property in this area and had been assured by the Planning
Department it would remain RE.

Commissioner Sharp stated the City Commission, Planning Commission and owners
in that area had an agreement, as outlined by Mr. Bills, which was consistent
with the Master Plan, and he believed this application should be denied and if
Mr. Bailey wished, he had ten days to file an appeal and the Commission would
be required by law to hold a public hearing. His Honor Mayor Gragson stated he
would at this time recommend denial.

11-18-59
Commissioner Elwell withdrew his motion that this application he referred,
hack to the Planning Commission.

RE to R-1 be denied.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson
voting aye; noes, none.

Mr. Bailey stated he was presently serving as a member of the Urban Renewal
Area Advisory Committee, having been appointed to this Board two years ago
by the City Commission, and had worked with this group under the direction
of Franklin Bills and Dave Kennedy. In this capacity he had been oriented
to the principles of good planning and that was the basis for this application.
Commissioner Sharp stated that he did not doubt his intentions or logic at
all, but he believed the Planning Commission had made a thorough study of
this and again stated the applicant had the right to appeal.

Department make the necessary estimates, so that the City might he advised of
Adopted	their portion of the expense, in order to budget and provide funds for the same.

Commissioner Sharp moved the following resolution be adopted and order made:

RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, BONANZA UNDERPASS, located within the City of Las Vegas, is a
state highway connecting route and construction and control must necessarily
be coordinated between the State Highway Department and the City of Las Vegas; and

WHEREAS, said underpass is woefully inadequate to handle the present
traffic by reason of the tremendous population growth within the City of
Las Vegas and more specifically due to the population growth and housing
developments to the West of said underpass; and

WHEREAS, over a period for more than a year, representatives of the City
of Las Vegas have held numerous conferences and corresponded with the State
Highway Department Officials in an effort to reach agreement concerning the
enlargement or new construction of said underpass; and

WHEREAS, investigation has shown that an overpass over Bonanza would be
more practicable since it would avoid the necessity of obtaining more land
and it would also avert the necessity of the large expense of extensive
drainage and controlling underground water and seepage; and

WHEREAS, the State Highway Department had agreed to install a second
traffic lane at or adjacent to the present underpass, at the estimated cost
of $550,000, upon the City securing the necessary right-of-way; and

WHEREAS, the City is agreeable to pay the difference between this cost and
the sum necessary to construct an overpass,

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City
of Las Vegas, at a regular meeting thereof held on the 18th day of November, 1959,
that the State Highway Department is urged to take prompt action in the construction
of an overpass at the same point where Bonanza Underpass now is and that the
State Highway Department make the necessary estimates so that this City may be
advised their portion of the expense in order to budget and provide funds for
the same;

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this Board places itself on record that such
planning, designing, budgeting of funds and construction be treated as urgent
in order to alleviate the present traffic hazard at said underpass;

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Board of City Commissioners has endeavored
to promote said construction and that cooperation and action are earnestly
requested from the State Highway Department.

MARJORIE HOLTSCHLAG, City Clerk

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson
voting aye; noes, none.

AMBULANCE SERVICE	City Manager Kennedy presented the Commission with financial and equipment

CONTRACT	reports of the Mercy Ambulance Service and the Las Vegas Emergency Ambulance

Service, which had been requested by the Commission on August 5, 1959, when
Held in Abeyance	consideration had been given the participation of the Las Vegas Emergency

Ambulance Service in the contract with the City presently held by the Mercy
Ambulance Service.

Mr. Kennedy stated that, upon checking over the reports, Mercy Ambulance 
equipment was in very good shape, with vehicles well-maintained and qualified as
emergency equipment, as required by the Police Department; furthermore, the
financial position of this company was sound. In regard to the Las Vegas
Emergency Ambulance Service, he said their financial condition was not 
outstanding, but for a small growing business it was not bad; however, when a
Police Department representative and two mechanics from the City Garage went
to check their equipment on two different occasions, they were unable to find
anyone there. They inspected the equipment on the premises and the report on
the same was far from satisfactory and only one piece of equipment was found
that was passable as emergency equipment out of four, one of which was not
useable.

11-18-59
Mr. William Curtis, operator of the Las Vegas Emergency Ambulance Service, addressed
the Commission, stating there was somebody on duty at his place of business 24 hours
a day and that he had 6 pieces of equipment, 2 of which were '59 Fords, which were
serviced by a mechanic every month. Mr. Curtis did not believe his equipment had
ever been inspected.

Chief of Police Ray Sheffer stated a traffic policeman was assigned to accompany
two City mechanics, and their report indicated they did go to Mr. Curtis' place of
business and conduct the investigation as well as they could, without an attendant,
as Mr. Kennedy had stated.

Commissioner Fountain asked Mr. Curtis what his regular charge was to pick up
accident victims on calls out of the City and he replied it was $15, flat fee, plus
$1 per mile for the first person, and the rest were half price; furthermore, Mr.

Curtis stated he had proof this was in accord with charges made by the other company.

Commissioner Fountain was of the opinion the Mercy Ambulance Service had performed
very satisfactorily; that the reports on this company in regard to their equipment
and financial status were very good, and was in favor of carrying on the contract
with them. Mr. Curtis cited an instance which occurred at 5:35 P-M. on October 27,
1959, in which Mercy Ambulance did not pick up an injured person within 25 minutes,
at which time the Police Department called his company. He stated, further, this
company had also refused someone without money. Mr. Curtis added the California
Highway Patrol had inspected his outfit and found it to be good.

Commissioner Whipple asked Mr. Curtis if he had refused to give a financial statement
to Dun & Bradstreet, and he stated he had refused them information over the telephone.
Commissioner Whipple asked Mr. Kennedy if the City presently had a binding contract
with the Mercy Ambulance Service, and Mr. Kennedy replied in the affirmative, stating
it would be necessary to give Mercy Ambulance Service 60 days notice if the 
Commission desired to rebid for this service or divide it between the two companies.

Commissioner Sharp raised the question of qualifications for drivers and attendants
employed by ambulance operators and suggested getting an opinion from a group of
doctors. Commissioner Whipple agreed this was extremely important. Mr. Kennedy
suggested they be required to have a Red Cross Certificate and Mr. Curtis was of
the opinion that would not be worth much. He added he employed four corpsmen.

George Dickerson, attorney for the Mercy Ambulance Company, was in favor of a complete
history as to each applicant's qualifications, including equipment and listing of
personnel, with their longevity of service in this particular field of endeavor. He
also stressed the importance of the qualifications of the ambulance drivers and
attendants, not only for welfare of the victim, but for preserving the scene. He
thought it would also be important to get a report from the law-enforcement agencies
as to the cooperation experienced with the applicants, as well as information from
the insurance adjusters in regard to claims where insurance companies must defray
the expense. Mr. Dickerson further suggested consideration be given to the 
background within the community of each applicant.

Chief Sheffer stated there was presently an ordinance being formulated that pertained
to the problem being discussed.

Commissioner Sharp moved this matter be held in abeyance and the City Manager be
instructed to make further report in regard to qualifications to be required of the

AND ALL OTHER ORDINANCES OR PARTS OF ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH; was
read by title and referred to Commissioners Fountain and Sharp; committee for
recommendation.

LIQUOR LICENSE	The Commission again considered the application of Karl and Leo Frey (Leroy

Corp.) for a Tavern License and license for four slot machines at the Moulin
Moulin Rouge Hotel	Rouge Hotel, 900 West Bonanza; favorable police report on the applicants.

This application was held in abeyance for a full Board at the last regular
Held in Abeyance	meeting of the Board of City Commissioners.

Dr. James B. McMillan; representing the NAACP, advised the Commission they
had knowledge of accommodations being refused to colored people by the present
operators of the Moulin Rouge Hotel; despite the understanding that this would
not happen; and that the hotel would operate in a democratic manner; therefore,
they were objecting to this application and recommending that it be denied.

Mr. Leo Frey, one of the applicants; disagreed with this statement and stated
there were several colored residents presently registered at the hotel; and
that they did not deny lodging because of race; however; they did refuse
service to anyone disorderly. He advised the Commission no one would be
refused service in the bar because of race if they were granted this license.

His Honor Mayor Gragson asked how many rooms there were in the Moulin Rouge
Hotel and Mr. Frey replied there were 105. Mayor Gragson asked the attorney
what the ordinance required and Mr. Whitmore advised the ordinance provided a
tavern was permitted in a hotel having more than 100 guest rooms.

Commissioner Sharp asked Mr. Frey if he would operate this as an inter-racial
hotel and he replied they would not refuse anyone admission to the bar because
of race or color. Mayor Gragson stated he hoped Mr. Frey realized if this
application was granted, that all concerned, including the Commission and the
entire community, would expect the operation to be conducted in this manner.

Dr. McMillan cited an instance where certain people, who came here to the Mobil
Convention, had confirmed reservations at the Moulin Rouge and were refused
	lodging when they arrived. He added there was nowhere for colored visitors to

stay. He believed this hotel could be operated with dignity as an inter-racial
hotel and did not see why it should be operated differently.

Commissioner Elwell asked if there would be any objection if the establishment
was operated as an inter-racial hotel, and Dr. McMillan stated if the hotel
was operated as had been in the past, there would be no objection. Dr. McMillan
cited another instance where four negroes from California asked for reservations
and waited 45 minutes before they were finally given accommodations. He added
this hassle to get rooms caused trouble which they did not want. Mr. Frey
stated that when colored people came into their place, they were not treated
any differently than anyone else.

Commissioner Fountain stated Mr. Frey was one of the original prime investors
who invested in and opened this as an inter-racial hotel in the west section
of the City, and moved this application be denied. Mr. Frey stated he bought
it in Bankruptcy Court. David Hoggard addressed the Commission, stating he
had attended a meeting when members of West Las Vegas agreed with what Mr. Frey
told them at that time, but since then the situation had changed. He added he
did not believe Mr. Frey was sincere when he said he would operate this as an
inter-racial hotel and that he (Mr. Frey) had used such excuses as renting only
to permanent guests or by the week when colored people had tried to rent
lodging. Mr. Hoggard said, because of the peculiarity of this location, he
was in favor of Commissioner Fountain's motion to deny this license at this time.

11-18-59
Commissioner Sharp stated this hotel had served a good function over there and
he concurred with Commissioner Fountain that, unless it could he definitely
for the purpose of an inter-racial hotel and not he restricted, this application
should he denied. He stated, further, he believed the applicant and the people
on the Westside should get together and get the matter straightened out.
Commissioner Fountain withdrew his motion to deny this application.

Commissioner Sharp moved the application of Karl and Leo Frey (Leroy Corp.)
for a Tavern License and license for four slot machines at the Moulin Rouge
Hotel, 900 West Bonanza, be held in abeyance.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Elwell and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson
voting aye; noes, none.

CASH PAYOUT 	Commissioner Fountain stated that some weeks ago Mr. Doig from the Showboat

PINBALL MACHINE	Hotel had asked him to come down to the Showboat Lanes and look at the bowling

POLICY	alleys, as he was interested in putting in two Automatic Payoff Pinball

Machines. He added he had done so and found the area in which he desired to
City Manager	place these machines was well-lighted and there was a man stationed within

to Investigate	ten feet. He added that this gentlemen had asked if he could come in and

discuss this matter with the Commission.

Jean Dutton, Supervisor of License and Revenue, stated that since the pinball
machines came out, it had been the policy that they not be permitted in places
where minors are allowed.

Mr. Doig stated that no official ruling had been made for or against the Automatic
Pinball Machine. He added they are a new type machine and should be classified
as a slot machine because of the cash payoff; however, they still came under the
ruling of a pinball machine and are licensed as a slot machine.

Mr. Kennedy stated according to the policy adopted by the Commission, these
machines were treated as a slot machine and were not to be placed where
minors were allowed. He suggested this policy could be changed if the Commission
so desired. Commissioner Sharp suggested perhaps this policy should be reviewed.

Commissioner Fountain stated, if it was permissible, he would like to have the
City Manager check this situation in regard to the Showboat location and also
to investigate this policy concerning the Payoff Pinball Machines.

FARM-CITY WEEK	Commissioner Whipple advised that he had been approached by Ferren Bunker of

PROCLAMATION	the local Clark County Agricultural Extension Service, requesting the City of

Las Vegas to proclaim the week of November 20 through November 26, 1959 as
Approved	"Farm-City Week" for the purpose of creating better public relations between

city and rural areas. He added it had also been requested that the Mayor
and Commissioners appear on some of the farms in the surrounding area.

The Commissioners expressed their approval of this program and instructed the
City Attorney to prepare an appropriate proclamation.

-oOo-

There being no further business to come before the Board, at the hour of 10:55 P.M.
Commissioner Elwell moved this meeting adjourn.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson

DOWNTOWN 	His Honor Mayor Gragson opened the meeting with the statement that the Commission

IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT	was not going to take any action on the Downtown Improvement District this evening

and that it would ha postponed for some time, in order for the plans to he worked out
more completely; so property owners concerned could know exactly what the improvements
were to be; then they could determine whether or not they would want them.

VACATION	This being the time heretofore set for public hearing regarding the petition of

(VAC-5-59)	Charleston Plaza, Inc. for the vacation to clear lot lines and vacate some street

right-of-way for the development of a shopping center, vacation to consist of
Public Hearing	Charleston Village Tract #1, with the exception of Lots 9, 10, 11 and 12, in

Block 7, and that portion of Peyton Drive commencing .at Burnham and extending 240'
Order Adopted	westerly. This vacation petition was approved at the regular Commission meeting

on October 23, 1959, subject to the following conditions, as recommended by the
Planning Commission, and Public Hearing was set for this time:

1.	The dedication of utility easements; as requested by the Southern Nevada
Power Company.

2.	Dedication and improvement of a cul-de-sac, as shown on the westerly end
of Peyton Drive.

3. Easements to the Las Vegas Valley Water District for existing water mains.

4. A street drainage design on the westerly edge property, to provide for

proper drainage of the Hillside Terrace area; including the dedication and
improvements of Peyton Drive across the power company easement; all to be
done in a manner satisfactory to the City Engineering Department.

$. Installation of fire hydrants, in accordance with the requirements of the Fire
Department.

6. Signing of an agreement, to be drawn up by the City Attorney, whereby

Charleston Plaza, Inc. will be fully responsible for drainage in the area
and will not hold the City liable for any resulting damage; said agreement
to be signed prior to the public hearing.

Paul Dollar, 1820 Peyton Drive, Mrs. Anthony Mazzuca, 1836 Peyton Drive, and
Wilma Grigor, 1830 Peyton Drive, were present to protest this vacation. Mr.

Dollar advised the Commission that Wendell Norman, 1824 Peyton Drive, who was
unable to attend this meeting, also wished to protest. Mr. Lollar stated further
that he did not know what this was all about; that he had never received any
notice of a hearing, and he was protesting because he did not know what was
going to be built around them.

Wilma Grigor stated she had received a notice of a Planning Commission Hearing
to be held on October 12, 1959; however, she had been informed this hearing had been
postponed, but never received notice of the postponement or of a subsequent
meeting to take its place. She added there was such a meeting and it was approved
to go ahead with the shopping center parking lot.

Planning Director Bills was of the opinion these people were confused with a

hearing conducted in relation to the change of the zoning in this area in which

the proposed vacation was located. He continued that this hearing tonight was

for the vacation of the streets recorded with the subdivision some six or seven

years ago which had never been improved, with the exception of a portion of

Peyton Drive, and this had been excluded from this vacation, due to the fact there were

four developed properties on this street which were under different ownerships.

These properties were also the reason for the cul-de-sac requirement included in
the Planning Commission recommendation.

William Peccole, President of Charleston Plaza, Inc., stated they were attempting
to develop a regional shopping center, consisting of approximately 35 acres, and
located at East Charleston Boulevard and Burnham Avenue. He continued that this
matter had been before the Board of Zoning Adjustment, Planning Commission and
the Board of City Commissioners, and he did not know of any meetings ever being
postponed. He added they were attempting at this time to vacate the streets
which have never been put in and were not asking to vacate that street in front

of the developed properties; furthermore, they were giving an easement for the

cul-de-sac on the westerly end of Peyton Drive.

Wilma Grigor asked what sort of structures were to be built around their homes
and it was determined they were to be surrounded by the parking areas. Mr.

Lollar stated he vigorously protested this. Mr. Peccole stated notices were
sent out for the hearing in regard to the rezoning of this property to C-1 and,

inasmuch as there were no protests to the rezoning, he did not know what else

they could expect in a C-1 zone and they should be willing to accept businesses
that would be developed. Mrs. Grigor stated she did not intend to approve the
C-1 zoning, but did not attend that hearing, as no notice was received of the
hearing after the first postponement.

Mr. Bills stated he could recall no postponement and, at the time of the rezoning
hearing, there were three property owners who wished to protest; however, after
an explanation of the proposal, they took the position if this particular plot
plan was followed they would have no further objection to it. He added this
rezoning had been accomplished and this property was now zoned C-1; the matter
presently before the Board was whether or not to approve the vacation of these
streets.

Commissioner Whipple reiterated that the zoning which permitted the parking lot
had already been accomplished. Mr. Lollar stated he received no notice of that
hearing. Mr. Bills stated he was in no position to swear these notices were
received, but he could testify a notice was sent to Ruth Lollar at 1820 Peyton
Drive; furthermore, these notices were mailed on October 30, 1959, setting forth
the hour of 7:30 P.M., November 12, 1959, for the Planning Commission Hearing,
and said hearing was legally advertised In a local newspaper for this time.

Mr. Bills continued that the Planning Commission minutes indicated that action was
taken at that time to forward the rezoning to the Board of City Commissioners,
with the recommendation for approval. He did not comprehend what was meant by a
postponement, as there was nothing in their records in that regard.

12-2-59
His Honor Mayor Gragson stated, that since the rezoning had been granted and the
vacation of these streets was not going to further affect their properties in
any way, he felt that the City Commission should approve the vacation, as
recommended by the Planning Department and the Planning Commission. Commissioner
Whipple stated he felt there had been a misunderstanding by these property
owners in regard to the rezoning; however, the vacation was the matter presently
before them, and he asked if they were protesting the vacation of these streets,
inasmuch as the rezoning had been accomplished.

Mrs. Grigor said she understood the vacation of the streets, but did not know how
it would affect the value of their properties and living conditions, and she
further mentioned the debris they had had to clean up in the past few weeks.

Mr. Peccole advised her that they had set up a parking agreement in leases to
their tenants whereby the landlord would be responsible for the lighting, 
landscaping and marking of the parking stalls, as well as for the cleaning of the
parking areas. Mrs. Grigor stated she was referring to the debris they had
picked up so far. Mr. Peccole said he would speak to the contractors, in an
effort to curtail this as much as possible, and he felt confident when the
buildings were completed they would find this to be a very orderly project.
Commissioner Fountain was of the opinion that the C-1 zoning would put these
property owners in a much better financial position.

Planning Director Bills stated everyone on the Planning Commission and in the
Planning Department had been aware of these four properties from the start of this
shopping center and, if this discussion had come up at their previous hearing,
these problems would have been given very careful consideration. He believed Mrs.
Grigor had something mixed up somewhere as no notices of a public hearing on
October 12, 1959, were sent out. He added there were 75 to 100 notices sent out
for the hearing on November 12, 1959, and that they had never been required to
send them out by Registered Mail; furthermore, out of this number sent there were
only four returned, none of which were the ones sent to these property owners.

Commissioner Fountain moved Vacation VAC-5-59 be approved, subject to the six
conditions as recommended by the Planning Commission, and the following Order of
Vacation be adopted and copy of order filed with the County Recorder of Clark
County:

USE PERMIT	The Commission again considered the application of Mrs. Vern Howard for a use

U-27-59	permit to allow Frederika M. Singer to conduct a private music school for piano,

accordion and guitar at 242 Boston Avenue, between Industrial Road and Fairfield,
Mrs. Vern Howard	legally described as Lots 18 and 19, Block 13, Meadows Addition in an R-4 zone.

This application was referred back to the Board of Zoning Adjustment by the City
Denied	Commission on November 4, 1959.

Commissioner Fountain moved the application of Mrs. Vern Howard for a use permit
be denied, as recommended by the Board of Zoning Adjustment, inasmuch as the
applicant had sold the property and the new owner had indicated that he did not
want a music school permit.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting
aye; noes, none.

USE PERMIT	The Commission considered the application of Myrill Rabb for a use permit to conduct

U-28-59	a commercial child nursery for 15 children less than one year old and 15 children

no more than two years old at 630 S. 3rd Street, generally located at the northwest
Myrill Rabb	corner of 3rd Street and Garces Avenue, legally described as Lots 17 and 18, Block

24, Clark's Las Vegas Townsite, in an R-4 zone.

Denied

Approval was recommended by the Board of Zoning Adjustment, providing no more than
24 children be allowed and subject to the following conditions: (There were 42

protests from surrounding property owners at the Board of Zoning Adjustment
hearing.)

1.	Compliance with all provisions of the Child Welfare Ordinance.

2.	Recommendations of the Fire and Building Departments.

3.	That the property be enclosed with a suitable fence; said fence being impervious
to children.

12-2-59
4. Agree to enter assessment district for street lights when one is formed.

That no more than 24 children he permitted.

Planning Director Bills advised the Commission that subsequent to the Board of
Zoning Adjustment Hearing, the Child Welfare Nurse had submitted a memo to the
Planning Department, stating the opinion that the Child Welfare Board would not
approve this application for any more than 12 children, if the use permit was
granted, because of conflict with State Regulations.

The applicant, Mrs. Rabb, stated there were two houses on the property and she
believed the Child Welfare Nurse meant she would be allowed 12 children in each
house. Mr. Bills stated this would not be correct, as the City Attorney had
advised that this was defined as only one property and only one nursery operation
could be allowed there. Mrs. Rabb said she was told at the time she bought the
property she would be able to operate two nurseries.

Mr. Charles Garner, attorney representing the protestants to this application,
stated their main objection was due to the piecemeal changing of the zoning and
that at the present this area was R-4 and developed for R-4 uses. Another
objection, he added, was the noise and parking problems which would be created
by allowing this permit for a non-conforming use. (At this time 12 people stood
up to be counted as protesting this matter.)

His Honor Mayor Gragson asked the Planning Director if he was in agreement with
the recommendation of the Board of Zoning Adjustment, and Mr. Bills replied this
use was not permitted as a matter of right in an R-4 zone and he believed caution
should be exercised in granting any additional rights where it would not be in the
best interest of property owners concerned.

Mr. Vance Geigley, 605 South 3rd., spoke in objection, stating that he did not
know how Mrs. Rabb obtained a permit to operate a nursery for 9 children at this
location in the first place, inasmuch as she did not live there. He was of the
opinion this was strictly a commercial deal for making money.

Mr. H. R. Pope, 626 South 3rd., stated he lived next door to this property in
question and he did not protest the nursery for the nine children, as he found
out from the Planning Department that such an operation was permissible in an
R-4 zone; however, he found the crying of the children did disturb his rest. He
concluded that they were protesting this use permit as a whole and not because of
the number of children to be allowed.

Mrs. Rabb stated with the limitation of 9 children she was unable to make out
financially and had to turn down additional children because she had her quota.

She added the need was very great for this type of nursery and the people she
employed, as well as herself, were willing to work long hours for little pay. She
continued that the operation had gone beyond the mercenary stage and her main
interest was in caring for these children; therefore, she was asking permission
to enlarge her nursery. Mrs. Rabb stated she now had nine infants under the
age of two, all of whom were kept in the house, and felt there should be no
complaint in regard to unnecessary noise. She added she could have had some of
her supporters present to speak, had she realized the necessity. Mrs. Rabb
concluded with the statement that her request was for 12 infants in one house
and 12 toddlers in the other house, and that the Child Welfare Board had said
there was ample room.

Vance Geigley stated that Mrs. Rabb had admitted her sole purpose was to make the
dollar. Commissioner Sharp asked him if he had any rentals on his property and
if he realized a profit on them. Mr. Geigley replied he had two rentals but did
not make anything on them; furthermore, he bought his home to live in, not for
the rentals.

Elizabeth R. Metcalf, 617 South 3rd, spoke in protest, stating that she had lived
at this location for 15 years and had abided by the R-4 zoning regulations. She
recommended that this use permit be denied for any more than 9 children in a
24-hour period.

-0O0-

At the hour of 8:45 P.M. this meeting was recessed and reconvened at the hour of
9:00 P.M., with all members present as of the opening session.

-0O0-

Commissioner Fountain stated he would like to commend Mrs. Rabb, whom he had
known many years, on her nursery; however, in this particular location, regardless
of whether or not the Child Welfare Ordinance would allow this operation to be
enlarged, he felt the area was too congested and moved the application for this
use permit be denied.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple who stated he admired Mrs. Rabb for her
fairness and he was sure she did not apply for this use permit with the idea of
injuring the other property owners; however, in view of the City Attorney's
opinion and the overwhelming number in opposition, he felt this application
should be denied. He continued that he felt very sorry for the situation in
which this placed Mrs. Rabb, because he felt she could be of fine service to the
community, and he hoped she could find another location.

Motion carried by the following vote:	Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp,

Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye; noes, none. Commissioner Elwell
stated Mrs. Rabb was a dedicated person whom he had known for a long time and that
she was doing a fine job in this field, but he would have to go along with the
Commission in recommending denial.

12-2-59
USE PERMIT U-29-59	Planning Director Bills presented the application of Louis Miranti for a use

permit to construct a water tank at the southwest corner of Washington Avenue
Louis Miranti	and Minnesota Street, legally described as Lots 1 and 2, Block 1, Las Vegas

Square, in an R-1 zone. Mr. Bills stated this proposed water tank was a part
Approved	of the water system for Brentwood and Golfridge Terrace; which was originally

proposed to be located in Golfridge, and, engineering-wise, either location
would serve. The proposed location was adjacent to a future fire station site.

Commissioner Sharp asked if there would be sufficient water to service other
areas and asked Mr. Miranti, if the need arose, if he would do so, and Mr.

Miranti stated he would if he had the water available.

Commissioner Fountain moved the application of Louis Miranti for a use permit
to construct a water tank at the southwest corner of Washington Avenue and
Minnesota Street be approved; as recommended by the Board of Zoning Adjustment;
subject to the following conditions:

1.	Conformance -to the plot plan as submitted.

2.	Signing of an improvement agreement and putting up a bond sufficient in amount
to cover the cost of the offsite improvements; as recommended by the Engineering

Department.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting
aye; noes, none.

USE PERMIT U-30-59	Planning Director Bills presented the application of Twin Lakes Shopping Center,

Twin Lakes Shopping	Inc., for a use permit to construct a filling station at 720 Tonopah Highway,

Center	legally described as a portion of the NW¼, SE¼, Section 29, T20S, R61E, generally

located on the east side of Tonopah Highway between Bonanza Road and Washington
Approved	Avenue in a C-1 zone.

Mr. Bills stated that because of this location and the proximity to this intersection, 
this application was referred to the Traffic and Parking Commission
and recommendation was deferred by that Board; pending investigation by the
Traffic and Parking Engineer; to determine if the filling station curb cuts
would be in accord with the proposed island designed for this location; subsequently,
 this engineer had given his opinion there would be no conflict with
this right-of-way nor with the public safety and convenience.

Commissioner Sharp moved the application of Twin Lakes Shopping Center; Inc.,
for a use permit to construct a filling station at 720 Tonopah Highway, be
approved as recommended by the Board of Zoning Adjustment, subject to
confirmation by the Traffic and Parking Commission of the Traffic Engineer's
recommendation and subject to the following conditions:

1.	Conformance to the plot plan as submitted.

2.	Signing of an improvement agreement and filing of a bond sufficient in
amount to cover the cost of offsite improvements; as recommended by the

Engineering Department.

3.	Conformance with the requirements of the Fire Department.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye;
Commissioner Fountain asked if the Traffic and Parking Commission would be
making the final decision on this application and Mr. Bills replied they would
merely take action at their next meeting to confirm the findings of the Traffic
Engineer. Commissioner Fountain voted no. His Honor Mayor Gragson commended
the Planning Department on the fine drawing of this proposed development, which
enabled them to see the exact situation.

USE PERMIT U-16-59	The Commission again considered the application of Wilbur Clank for a use permit

to construct a gasoline filling station at 1550 Tonopah Highway, generally located
Wilbur Clark	at the southeast corner of Vegas Drive and Tonopah Highway (U. S. Highway 95),

legally described as Lot 1, and a portion of Lots 19 and 20, Block 21, Twin Lakes
Held in Abeyance	Village Unit #5; in a C-1 zone.

Planning Director Bills advised that the rezoning of this property to C-1 was
approved on the basis that this parcel could not be properly used for a singlefamily 
home and at that time it was understood an application for a use permit to
allow the filling station would have to be approved by the Board of Zoning Adjustment 
and the City Commission. Such an application was subsequently submitted
to the Board of Zoning Adjustment, property owners were notified, public hearing
held, and there was on file the protests to this application.

Mr. Bills stated further that the Board of Zoning Adjustment could not arrive at
a decision and the application was referred to this Board of City Commissioners
on November 4, 1959 without recommendation. At that time this Board referred the
application to the Planning Commission and a sub-committee was appointed to study
this matter. As a result, the Planning Commission recommended this application be
denied. Mr. Bills advised there were some people present who wished to be heard
on this matter.

Robert Smith, 3037 Vegas Drive, stated his home was directly alongside of this
property and he had lived there four years. He added a filling station was not
needed at this location, and was of the opinion this property could be put to a
better use for the community; therefore, he was opposed to this application 100%.

He added the applicant had said he would erect a 6' concrete wall between his home
and the station; however, he felt that would be like living in a prison.

Max N. Harden, 1305 Arrowhead Avenue, spoke in protest, stating that at the time
this rezoning came up before the Planning Commission it was stated by the real
estate gentleman present that the reason for the zoning change was so they could
construct a gas station, and at that time the Planning Commission unanimously
turned it down and so did the City Commission. He continued that the second time

12-2-59
it came up before the Planning Commission he did not think too many of them
objected to the C-1 zoning, as they realized that this lot would have to be
rezoned for some commercial use. Mr. Harden added that Mr. Garth of the
Planning Commission stated emphatically that in changing the zoning to C-l,
it would allow the applicant to place some kind of business on this corner and
it was stated then that it would not be a gas station. At one time, Mr. Harden
explained, construction of a house was started on this lot and then it was subsequently 
torn down and they had been told a little City Park was to be developed
there. He concluded there were others who were in protest but were not present
as he himself had not been aware this application was to be considered tonight
until he had read it in the evening newspaper, and he urged that this permit be
denied for a gas station and this property be developed into some other
commercial use.

Mrs. Max Harden, representing her neighbor, Thelma Pike, whose property was
adjacent to this location, stated she definitely did not want a gas station
constructed there because of the fumes, traffic and general cluttering up of
the area.

Julius Gabriele, 1301 Arrowhead, objected to this use permit for a gas station as
he owned a $65,000 home and such a use would lower the value of his property.

Herbert Jones, Attorney representing the applicant, stated this made the 6th or
8th appearance he had made in regard to this matter and he believed the Commission
was very familiar with the problem before them. As to the possibility of
another type of building, this small triangular lot would not allow for sufficient
parking required by City ordinance. Mr. Jones believed it was the Commission's
duty and desire to see that land in the community was put to beneficial use and
not have it remain undeveloped. He mentioned the fact that the service station
owner across the street had had the audacity to protest; furthermore, some of the
objectors had little reason to protest and he believed that ultimately a service
station would be put in there as there would be inadequate parking for any other
type of commercial development.

Commissioner Sharp stated this was a very difficult decision to make and he was
in sympathy with the property owners; however, the service station across the
street, which he believed was constructed before the houses were built, represented
an identical situation.

Commissioner Fountain stated the subdivider should never have allowed this
triangular piece of property to remain there and, inasmuch as it was the policy
of the City Commission to meet with the Planning Commission when they did not
concur with their recommendation, he moved the application of Wilbur Clark for
a use permit to construct a gasoline filling station at 1550 Tonopah Highway be
held in abeyance, and a meeting between the Planning Commission and City 
Commission for discussion on this matter be held at 7:00 P.M., December 8, 1959,
in the Office of the Mayor at the City Hall.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting
aye; noes, none.

VARIANCE V-19-59	Planning Director Bills presented the application of Lewis J. and Katie Abrahams

for a variance to construct 9 motel units and a utility room at 1919 Sunrise
Lewis & Katie	Street, between 18th and 19th Streets, legally described as Lots 19, 20 and 21,

Abrahams	Block 3, Church Addition, in an R-3 zone. He added this property was a continuation

of property fronting on Fremont, presently used for a motel, and the applicants
Referred to Planning	proposed to extend this use over all of their property.

Commission

Mr. Bills stated that sometime ago the applicants present a request to the Planning
Commission to rezone this property and property owners on Sunrise Avenue, to the
north, protested because they did not want a motel across from their homes, due
to the congestion of traffic. He continued that public hearing was held and subcommittee
 appointed to study that application, with resulting recommendation that
it be denied. Then the Planning Commission advised the applicants to apply for a
variance permit and in that way some particular control could be kept on the rear
access.

Approval of the variance permit was recommended by the Board of Zoning Adjustment,
subject to the following conditions: (There was one protest at the Board of

Zoning Adjustment hearing.)

1.	Conformance to the plot plan as submitted. (Plot Plan shows a 6' concrete
fence along Sunrise Avenue.)

2.	Signing of an improvement agreement and filing of bond sufficient in amount to
cover cost of offsite improvements, as recommended by the Engineering 
Department .

3.	That the storage of garbage cans be prohibited along the Sunrise Avenue
frontage and that no signs or other forms of advertising be permitted along
Sunrise Avenue.

Mr. Bills advised that the Fire Department specifically recommended that access
be provided at the rear on Sunrise Avenue, for firefighting purposes, and it
appeared to him the only solution would be for the City Commission to deny or
approve this application, subject to the conditions as recommended by the Board
of Zoning Adjustment, or subject to assess requested by the Fire Department. Mr.
Bills stated a Vacation Hearing (VAC-8-59) on this alley was being held by the
City Commission on January 6, 1960, and it might be desired to defer action on
this matter until after this hearing.

Commissioner Sharp asked if a motel was a permitted use in an R-3 zone, which
was the present zoning of this property, and Mr. Bills replied a motel was
allowed as a regular use in a commercial zoning; however, in an R-4 zoning a
motel was a permitted use only when the property abuts a major highway and in a
C-1 zone a motel was allowable with certain restrictions. Commissioner Sharp was
of the opinion this property should be rezoned from R-3 to C-1, as the present

12-2-59
zoning was inconsistent with good zoning practices, and in that way everyone
would he satisfied. He believed this was a problem for the Planning Commission.

Mr. Bills was of the opinion this might be logical, due to the fact that there
was little likelihood this property could be developed as anything except an
extension of these motel units.

Commissioner Whipple moved the application of Lewis J. and Katie Abrahams for a
variance to construct 9 motel units and a utility room at 1919 Sunrise Avenue,
between 18th and 19th Streets, be referred to the Planning Commission to consider
the rezoning of this property from R-3 to C-1.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Elwell and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting
aye; noes, none.

REZONING Z-29-59	Commissioner Fountain moved the amended application of the Leroy Investment Company

and Leo Frey for the reclassification of property legally described as a portion
Leo Frey	of the S½, NE¼, SE¼, Section 28, T20S, R61E, MDB&M, generally described as only

(Leroy Investment	that property upon which the Moulin Rouge Hotel was presently located, from R-1

Co.)	to C-2 be approved and the City Attorney be instructed to prepare the necessary

ordinance amendment.

Approved

Motion seconded by Commissioner Elwell and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting
aye; noes, none.

NO PARKING ZONE	Commissioner Whipple moved the request of Mr. G. T. Reed, American Buslines, for

a No Parking Zone along the west side of the north-south alley located between
Alley between 1st	1st and 2nd Streets, from Fremont to Carson, be approved as recommended by the

& 2nd, Fremont to	Traffic and Parking Commission.

Carson

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:

Approved	Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting

aye; noes, none.

NO PARKING ZONE	Commissioner Whipple moved the request of Mr. Ted Glenn for a No Parking Zone

along the north side of San Francisco Avenue, between Las Vegas Boulevard South
San Francisco	and Paradise Road, be approved as recommended by the Traffic and Parking Commission.

between L. V. Blvd. S.

& Paradise Road	Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:

Approved	Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting

aye; noes, none.

Mr. Bills advised that a request had been sent to the Clark County Commissioners
for a similar No Parking Zone along the south side of San Francisco, between
Las Vegas Boulevard South and Paradise Road.

NO PARKING ZONE	The Commission considered the recommendation by the Traffic and Parking Commission

for a No Parking Zone along the west curb line of Main Street, beginning at a

Main Street,	point 175' south of Stewart and extending south to a point 150' south of Carson.

between Stewart

and Carson	This proposal would make it possible to make a third south-bound traffic lane for

this portion of Main Street, which would allow the use of the inside lane strictly
Held in Abeyance	for left hand turning movements into Ogden, Fremont and Carson, and still leave two

lanes for through traffic. This proposal had been discussed in considerable
detail with representatives of the James Cashman Company, The Union Pacific Railroad 
Company, and the Greyhound Bus Lines. The Cashman Company and the Bus Lines
were in accord with the recommendation, provided arrangements could be made to
provide them additional access to their properties through property which is now
owned by the Railroad Company.

The Traffic and Parking Commission voted to recommend approval of this program
and also recommended that City funds be provided to construct the curb cuts and
paving, as shown on the plot plan submitted by the Traffic Engineer, with the
provision that the Railroad Company dedicate to the City such property as might
be needed for this construction.

Commissioner Sharp moved this matter be held in abeyance for further study and
investigation.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting
aye; noes, none.

URBAN RENEWAL	Coordinator of Urban Renewal, Franklin Bills, advised the Commission that in order

for the City to remain eligible to receive Federal assistance in various phases
Workable Program	of the City's Urban Renewal Program, including redevelopment project loans and

Progress Report	grants and special F.H.A. insurance provisions, it would be necessary for the City

to have in effect a current certified Workable Program to combat slums and blight.
Approved	The present certification of the program was to expire January 1, 1960.

To justify a request for re-certification, it was necessary to submit a report to
the Housing and Home Finance Agency, listing progress made in each of the seven
elements of the program during the past year, and a statement of goals to be
sought during the coming year. This report had. been prepared by the various
department and division heads directly affected and put together by the Coordinator
of Urban Renewal and it was requested that the City Commission approve this report
so that it might be forwarded to the Federal Agency without delay. In reply to
Commissioner Whipple's question, Mr. Bills advised this would put the City under
no obligation whatsoever.

Commissioner Elwell moved the Workable Program Progress Report be approved and
forwarded to the Housing and Home Finance Agency, as requested by the Coordinator
of Urban Renewal.

GIRL SCOUTS OF AMERICA	City Manager Kennedy stated some years ago the Frontier Girl Scout Council was

leased a plot of ground in Squires Park adjacent to the State Building and they
Frontier Council	now had the necessary financing to go ahead with the construction of a building

there. Mr. Kennedy added he had discussed with them the possibility of locating
their headquarters on another parcel of City land, as this present location was
going to be one of the busiest corners in Las Vegas.

Commissioner Fountain stated that the Fair and Recreation Board had approved the
Girl Scouts' use of one of the rooms in the Convention Hall for a nominal fee,
and he believed this arrangement would take care of their immediate needs; 
therefore, he suggested this matter be held in abeyance and in the meantime the
possibility of another site should be investigated. Commissioner Sharp recommended
that a meeting be arranged between the City Commissioners and representatives
of this group to discuss this matter.

SEWAGE SYSTEM	City Manager Kennedy advised the Commission at the present time the City had been

HOOKUP RATES	accepting sewer connections to property outside but adjacent to the City Limits

and there had been a request from a property owner out on West Charleston to
Outside Sewer	connect into the City Sewer System; however, he was unable to get the release

Connections	from the County Commissioners to allow the recovery of their funds when they

came into the City.

Payment Formula

Approved	At the regular meeting of the Board of City Commissioners, held November 4, 1959,

Director of Public Works Sauer presented the request of Mr. M. A. Schneider,
owner of the shopping center at the corner of Arville and Charleston, which was
in the County and not connected into the City Sewer, wherein he would like to have
the Board of City Commissioners consider a refund for the difference in the rates
charged within the City and outside the City, if and when this property should
become annexed to the City. At that time the Commission did not approve the
return of the moneys, and moved this matter be held in abeyance for further study.

Mr. Kennedy continued that this was a problem of some note, as the connection fee
was rather high, but fair, and that a formula had been worked out on the scale
presently being charged whereby, if the connection fee was over $1,000, payment
would be allowed in five yearly installments. If, in the meantime, the property
became annexed to the City, the payments would cease; in other words, if it became
a part of the City within three years, only 3/5ths of the payments would be required
and, if not, the whole amount would be paid over the five year period and the
owner would not be entitled to any refund.

Berkley Square	at 1628 "G" Street. This petition, filed by the Berkley Square Housing Association,

Housing Assoc.	complained of debris and unsanitary conditions at these locations.

Report	Mr. Kennedy stated a representative of the Planning Department had inspected

these properties and some effort was being made to improve the conditions of
these properties by the owner and lessee. He stated further that a check will
be kept on the progress to eliminate these conditions.

CASH PAYOUT	City Manager Kennedy advised the Commission that at the last meeting of the Board

PINBALL MACHINE	of City Commissioners, held November 18, 1959, he had been requested to look into

the matter of cash payout pinball machines at the Showboat Lanes and the Las Vegas

Showboat Lanes	Bowl, and that he and Mr. Dutton had looked over the situation at these two places,

& Las Vegas Bowl	      as had a representative of the Police Department, with the conclusion that the

clerk at the Showboat Lanes had other duties to attend to and would not be in a
Report	position to continually watch any cash pinball machines that might be placed there.

As to the Las Vegas Bowl, there was presently a cash pinball machine out in the
open and one had been requested for the Billiard Room, in which anyone under the
age of 21 years would not be allowed, and Mr. Kennedy suggested, as long as a
cash pinball machine had been requested for the Billiard Room, the one presently
located out in the open should be moved in there. He further stated the owner
had been notified this present machine would have to be removed by the end of
the Federal Tax period, which would be June 30, 1960.

Commissioner Fountain asked how many pinball machines were presently located at
Las Vegas Bowl and Mr. Kennedy advised there were 5 or 6 but only one of them was
a cash payout pinball machine.

CLERK	an increase in the salary of the Court Clerk.

Held in Abeyance	Commissioners agreed with his recommendation.

MEMORIAL HOSPITAL	had been paying the Southern Nevada Memorial Hospital per month for cases sent

FEE	there by the Police Department and that from the figures given to them it had

proved to him that the City should increase the present rate of $200, and moved
Police Dept. Cases	that it be increased to $600 per month, effective January 1, 1960.

Increased

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp, who stated he believed $600 still was not
an equitable amount; however, it was necessary to work under the present budget,
and he had requested the Hospital Board to give them a list of charges each
month, so this information could be considered when the next budget was formulated.

Motion carried by the following vote:	Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp,

Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson voting aye; noes, none. Commissioner Fountain
requested the Chief of Police to keep these hospital cases from the City Jail
at a minimum.
