Honorable Mayor E. W. Cragin
and Board of City Commissioners,

Las Vegas, Nevada

In re:	PROPOSED AMENDMENT OF SUBDIVISION NO. 77OF SECTION 2 OF ORDINANCE NO.

349 OF THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS

Gentlemen:

Pursuant to your request for an opinion as to the constitutionality of the
proposed amendment of Subdivision No. 77 of Section 2 of Ordinance No. 349
of the City of Las Vegas, which was prepared and submitted to your Honorable
Board for passage by the law firm of Morse and Graves, I have researched the
legal problems involved therein and submit the following.

The problems involved in this proposed ordinance are:

(1)	Whether the legislative body (the Board of Commissioners

of the City of Las Vegas) has the authority and power under
its Charter to regulate businesses of all kinds, and

(2)	To what extent the said legislature can regulate the parti-
cular type of business covered in said proposed ordinance, and
