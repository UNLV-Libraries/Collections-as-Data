of the area over and above a public alley. Mr. Silvagni owns property
on both sides of and abutting the alley at the easterly portion of Block
15, Clark's Las Vegas Townsite.

On the above-mentioned date the Commission took this matter under advise-
ment and ordered a study made with regard to the possibility of permitting
such use.

On January 27, 1948, the Planning Commission, upon report of the City
Engineer, discussed and considered the various aspects of this problem
and, Upon motion duly made and unanimously carried, recommends the
following as the basis of permitting structural development over alley-
ways, provided such procedure is first approved by the City Attorney
as to compliance with any laws relative to permitting or prohibiting
such use:

1.	Lease-Rental Arrangement to be determined upon square foot
basis for area covered, such charge being established in
relation to appraised value of abutting property.

2.	Legal Clearance required to be maintained above paved surface
of alley.

3.	Utilities and Public Facilities within, over, and above said
alley to be properly rearranged with the approval of the
utilities or operating agency concerned, and/or the City of
Las Vegas.

4.	Structural Development over and above alley area to be approved
by the City of Las Vegas through the Building Department or
other departments as deemed necessary.

This recommendation is forwarded to your Honorable Board as a basis for
such permits only, and is not to be construed as a recommendation that
any such permits to be issued until the proper legal counsel has been
secured and the plan established as a matter of policy by the Board of
City Commissioners. It is possible that any permits, if granted for
such use, be on the basis of a separate ordinance for each and every
case.

Respectfully yours,

LAS VEGAS -- CLARK COUNTY
JOINT PLANNING COMMISSION
s/ C. G. Petrie
City Engineer
