City Attorney Cannon advised the Commission that the State Legislature
recently passed a law that requires a public hearing when land is acquired
by the County or School District, consequently it would be necessary to
comply with this provision prior to leasing property in the Hyde Park
and John C. Fremont School areas to the Clark County Fair and Recreation
Board for the construction of swimming pools.

ting the public hearing on this matter on November 6, 1957 at 8:00 P.M.:
