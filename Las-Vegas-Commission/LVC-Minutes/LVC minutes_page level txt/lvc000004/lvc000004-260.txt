OFFICE OF THE CITY CLERK CITY OF
LAS VEGAS CLARK COUNTY, NEVADA.

APRIL 4th, 1940

Minutes of a regular meeting of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas Clark
County, Nevada held on the 4th day of April 1940 at the hour of seven thirty P.M.

Present Mayor Russell, Commissioners Gilbert, Krause and Corradetti, City Attorney and
City Clerk.

Absent Commissioner Ronnow.

Minutes of recessed regular meeting of March 29th read. Commissioner Gilbert ask that the
statement of Mayor Russell make to the Board at that time be incorporated in the minutes. Mayor
Russell handed the Clerk his witten statement as made to the Board at the meeting of March 29th
so that minutes of said meeting be corrected to read as follows:

In preparing a budget for the City of Las Vegas for the year 1940, we must have a true
statement of the actual Dec 31, 1938 bank balance, which is $49,733.89 as shown by the Annual
Financial Report of the City of Las Vegas dated Dec 31 1938. We must then take the amount of
money collected by the City in 1939 which is $192,829.00 and add $49,733.89 ( the 1939 bank bal-
ance) which would give us $241,162.89. All the money handled by the City in 1939.

The City spent $179,736.00 in 1939. To get our bank balance for Dec 31, 1939 you would have
to deduct $179,736.00 (the money spent by the City in 1939) from $241,162.89 (which is the 1938
bank balance and the money collected in 1939) this would give you $62,826.89. The correct
bank balance to start the 1940 budgeon , as I see it.

The proposed budget for 1940, (prepared by Mr. Ronnow, who was at that time Finance Commis-
sioner and Mr. Blackman the City Auditor) does not make sense. In the first place our bank bal-
ance as of Dec 31, 1939, taken from the fund statement was $62,826.69.

The bank balance used by Mr Ronnow and Mr. Blackman is preparing the 1940 budget for Las
Vegas was $53,785.83 a discrepancy of $9,040.70. A financial report on file in the City Clerk's
Office, shows the City balance as of December 31 1939 to be $51,092.61 a discrepancy of $11,754.08
A fund statement prepared by Mr. Blackman as of Dec 31,1939 is as follows:

Bank Balance Nov 30-39	$47,575.67

Taxes 4th installment	31,162.06

Dec Receipts	 9,032.25

Making a total Bank account of	87,769.98

Dec Expenditure (which includes the

$11,754.08 item) was	____24.943.29

Bank balance as of Dec 31 1939	62,826.69

Now if the sum of $11,754.08 is again taken out of the bank balance of $62,826.69 as of Dec
31,1939 we would have $51,092.61 as shown by the financial statement on file in the City Clerk's
office.

This item of $11,754.08 has been taken out of the bank balance at least twice since Nov.

80-39 as I figure it.

I do not believe in padding our budget.

If I can read this is what has been done.

At this time I	am	going to insist that an audit be made of the City books so	that we will

not be in the dark.	If	not, I think a grand jury investigation would be in order.	As long as	I

am mayor of this City I am going to insist that all our City business be conducted out in the open.
We will make mistakes, and many of they but I hope they will be honest mistakes.

The business of adopting a Resolution empowering the City of Las Vegas to make an emer-
gency loan in the sum of $20,000.00 was next considered and on motion of Commissioner Gilbert
seconded by Commissioner Corradetti the following Preambles and Resolution were duly adopted:
