At this time the Board continued the discussion of the desirability and advisability of
building a municipal golf course at Las Vegas, it appearing to the Board that there is a
large amount of unemployment at present in the City and that funds from Federal Government are
now available for such purpose, and that the Las Vegas Golf Association has already raised
the sum of Fifteen Hundred Dollars ($1500) to contribute to the City toward the sponsor's
contribution of Four Thousand Dollars ($4000) for such project, and that such project will be
a great benefit to the said City, and will be self-supporting when once built, therefore,
after general consideration of the matter, it was the unanimous opinion of the members of the
Board that proper steps be taken toward the building of such municipal Golf Course. Thereupon
on Motion of Commissioner Krause seconded by Commissioner Marble, the following Resolution
was introduced:

RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, the City of Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada, has for some time past been desirous
of building a Municipal Golf Course at Las Vegas to attract more people to come to this com-
munity and build homes and make investments here, and

WHEREAS, the said City of Las Vegas would have built such course ere this time, had there
been any way to do so without having the total cost thereof fall upon the taxpayers of said
City, and

WHEREAS, it is now possible to obtain from the Government of the United States, financial aid
for such project, provided said City will stand sponsor for the cost thereof up to the sum
of Four Thousand Dollars ($4,000.00), and

WHEREAS, the Las Vegas Golf Association has already, by volunteer subscription by and from
its members and certain of the business people and citizens of said City, secured the sum of
Fifteen Hundred Dollars ($1500) which it is willing to contribute toward said amount of Four
Thousand Dollars (4,000) to be paid by said City as the sponsor's contribution, and

WHEREAS, the said Golf Association has represented to said City that such golf course, once
built, will be selfsupporting and in addition thereto, will produce enough revenue to repay
said City the money to be advanced therefor, and

WHEREAS, application for said aid from the United States Government has already been made
and because of the present effort of the government to reduce unemployment, the Government
is willing that such project go forward, and

WHEREAS the present number of unemployed people in this community is now altogether too
large and is constantly increasing, and

WHEREAS, except for the several Federal Aid Projects now contemplated by said City, there
appears no method of caring for said unemployed people, and

WHEREAS, THE City deems it a better policy to sponsor Federal Aid Projects, including said
golf course, in order to furnish employment to such unemployed persons, than to permit them
to become public charges entirely at the expense of the taxpayers, of the City, and

WHEREAS, the said contemplated building of such golf course will furnish employment to a
number of such unemployed persons, and

WHEREAS, the said golf course, when completed, will be a great asset to said City, and

WHEREAS, said City already owns land near the present fish hatchery ponds on which said golf
course can be built, and

WHEREAS, there are at present no funds in the Treasury of said City not allocated to other
purposes, which can be used for such purpose, and by reason of the foregoing facts, an
emergency exists sufficient to warrant said City in making a loan of Twenty-five Hundred
($2500) which can be obtained from the First National Bank of Nevada, Las Vegas Branch, at
a rate of interest less than eight per cent per annum,

NOE, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, that
the City of Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada, do borrow from the First National Bank of
Nevada, Las Vegas Branch, the sum of Twenty-five Hundred Dollars ($2500) for the term of
two and one-half (2½) years, with interest at a rate not to exceed eight per cent per annum
And be it further resolved that the Mayor of the said City of Las Vegas, and the City Clerk
be and they hereby are authorized and empowered to make, execute and deliver a promissory
note or promissory notes on behalf of said City, aggregating the said sum of Twenty-five
Hundred Dollars ($2500), to be redeemed at the option of this Board at any time when money
is available in the emergency tax fund of said City, to be levied by said City at the first
tax levy following the creation of such indebtedness, as by law provided.

It was then moved by Commissioner Krause and seconded by Commissioner Marble that action
upon said Resolution be deferred until a regular meetings of this Board to be held on the
Friday the 4th day of March, A.D. 1938, at the hour of seven o'clock P.M. And that the City

least two publications, one week apart, in the Las Vegas Evening Review Journal, a newspaper
of general circulation, printed and published in said City of Las Vegas, Clark
County, Nevada.
