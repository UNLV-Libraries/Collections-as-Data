Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

At this time the Commission considered the application of Alfred Durante, Leo Massaro, Italo
Ghelfi, Robert Picardo, Fred DeTore, Bernard F. Perata, A. A. Harris, and Remy Gacherieu for
gaming license for the Golden Gate Club located at 1 Fremont Street. The Police Department
reported that eight of the twenty-three applications have been investigated and they are not
in a position to recommend complete approval of the license until the remaining participants
have been thoroughly investigated.

abeyance until the investigation on the majority interests has been completed and the appli-
cants be notified of this fact.
