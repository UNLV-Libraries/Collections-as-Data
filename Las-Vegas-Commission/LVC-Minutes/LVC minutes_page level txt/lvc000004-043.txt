Mr. C.D. Baker, City Engineer,

Las Vegas, Nevada.

Dear Sir;

In connection with our subcontract for paving streets in the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, under contract
Number Nev. 1021 D, we respectfully request we be allowed to pay by check instead of cash.

We feel that there is considerable risk in connection with the handling of large amounts of cash, hold-
ing same in our hands over night or until men are paid, also that we do not have the value of a cancelled cheek
as a receipt from men as payment for wages.

We wish to add that our banking will be done by the local bank.

Yours Truly,

U.B. Lee, by Irving Elliot.

On motion of Commissioner Down seconded by Commissioner Krause it was moved and carried that Mr. U.B. Lee be
given permission to pay his employees by check, if the granting of this permission meet with the approval of
the State PWA Director.

Vote was Commissioners Down, Krause, marble and Perry and His Honor the Mayor voting aye. Noes, none.
