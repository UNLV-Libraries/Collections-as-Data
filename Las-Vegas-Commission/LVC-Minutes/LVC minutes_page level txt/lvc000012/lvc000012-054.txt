MINUTES	Las Vegas, Nevada

February 3, 1960

A regular meeting of the Board of Commissioners of the City of
Las Vegas, Nevada, held this 3rd day of February, 1960, was called
to order at the hour of 7:30 P.M., with the following members
present:

Mayor	Oran K. Gragson

Commissioner	William H. Elwell

Commissioner	E. W. Fountain

Commissioner	Harris P. Sharp

Commissioner	Reed Whipple

City Manager	A. H. Kennedy

Adm. Assistant	Robert D. Heath

City Attorney	Calvin M. Cory

Public Works Director	Richard P. Sauer

Planning Director	Franklin J. Bills

City Clerk	Edwina M. Cole

His Honor, Mayor Gragson, called the meeting to order, requesting
that everyone rise, whereupon the Pledge of Allegiance was given.

Rev. Walter Bishop, Pastor of the First Baptist Church, gave the
Invocation.

His Honor, Mayor Gragson, informed the meeting there would be no
public hearing on Assessment District No. 100-28 this evening.

City Attorney Cory advised all who were interested that it had
become necessary to propose a revised Ordinance for the Fremont
Street lighting and widening, due to the fact that there was a
change in the specifications of which his office was not aware, and
the Ordinance adopted at the last meeting (No. 817) contained
Specifications not now on file in the office of the City Clerk and,
therefore, in order to insure the validity of the bonds, if and
when sold, it would be necessary to adopt a new Ordinance and
rescind the one previously adopted.

An Ordinance entitled:	AN EMERGENCY ORDINANCE REPEALING EMERGENCY

ORDINANCE NO. 817 AND DECLARING THE DETERMINATION OF THE BOARD OF
COMMISSIONERS OF THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, TO MAKE CERTAIN

WHICH PROTESTS AGAINST THE PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE CREATION OF
SUCH DISTRICT MAY BE HEARD AND CONSIDERED BY SAID BOARD; DIRECTING
NOTICE THEREOF TO BE GIVEN; PROVIDING OTHER MATTERS RELATING THERETO;
AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY, was read by title by City Attorney Cory,
who stated that this Ordinance was eligible for adoption at this
time.

Commissioner Sharp moved the above-entitled Ordinance No. 822 be
adopted.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Elwell and carried by the following
vote:	Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor,

Mayor Gragson, voting aye; noes, none.

City Attorney Cory advised that, in connection with this Ordinance
just adopted, it was also necessary for the Board of Commissioners
to adopt a Resolution, setting the time and place for a protest
