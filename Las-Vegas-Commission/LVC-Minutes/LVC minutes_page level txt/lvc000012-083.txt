Mr. Robert Hirsh addressed the Commission, stating he and James Arlin
had submitted an application for a package liquor and beer license at
a location on West San Francisco and Tam Drive, where a proposed
shopping center, to be known as Minute Mart is to be erected. Because
their lease required them to submit plans for installations, Mr. Hirsh
and Mr. Arlin requested information as to whether the Board of City
Commissioners would approve their application for a liquor license,
based on a favorable police report.

Commissioner Sharp advised that two licenses would be available after
the taking of the census, as it was estimated this would show a
population of 60,000.

To Commissioner Fountain's question as to how far their establishment
would be located from that of Joe Julian, Mr. Hirsh replied it would be
in excess of 1,000 feet. Commissioner Fountain then stated he would
help Mr. Hirsh and Mr. Arlin in any way possible, but added this was
not to be construed as a commitment.

Commissioner Sharp advised he had received two or three calls from
Modeling Agencies, complaining about the Recreation Department
program on modeling, stating he did not believe the Recreation
Department should compete with Modeling Agencies and he was of the
opinion this matter should be investigated by the City Manager.

Superintendent of Recreation Bruce Trent stated their program was
known as the Charm Club and consisted of about 50 teen-agers.
