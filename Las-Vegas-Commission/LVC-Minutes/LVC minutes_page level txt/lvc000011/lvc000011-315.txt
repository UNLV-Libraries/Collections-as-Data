PETITION FOR STREET LIGHTS            City Manager Kennedy presented a petition from property owners in the area of 15th
Bridger and Lewis on 15th                   Street and Bridger and 15th Street and Lewis for installation of street lights on those
Street	corners. The Engineering Department estimated that the cost for these installations

would run about $1,800.00 for each street light and that it would possibly take two
lights down in that area. The circuit would have to be brought in from Carson Street.

It is recommended that one new light be installed.

Mr. Kennedy further stated that 15th Street is to come under a street widening program
in the near future and it was suggested that temporary lights be installed until such
time as the street widening program is started.

A City Employee by the name of Mr. G. W. Contner, Captain from the Fire Department,

410 South 16th Street, spoke to the Commission regarding the need for street lights
in this entire area. He mentioned that it is very dark and that it has been necessary
to have police down there and that it is not safe for their women or children to go
out after dark. He stated that the people there pay as much taxes as anyone and
asked why they could not get proper street lighting installed. He mentioned his
neighbor Dean Burlingame has told him that it is necessary to know somebody to get
these petitions circulated around.

Mr. Kennedy explained to him that this would have to be put in as a street light
assessment and petition would have to be signed by 51 percent of the property owners
in the area and that the City Attorney would assist them as to the form to use for
the petition and also would answer any other questions that they might have.
