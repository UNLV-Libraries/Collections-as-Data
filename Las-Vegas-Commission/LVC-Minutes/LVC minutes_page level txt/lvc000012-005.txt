(CALL OF SPECIAL MEETING)

A special meeting of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas,
Nevada, held this 8th day of December, 1959, was called to order at
the hour of 7:00 P.M., with the following members present:

Mayor	Oran K. Gragson	City Manager	A. H. Kennedy

Commissioner	Wm. H. Elwell	Adm.Assistant Robert D. Heath

Commissioner	E. W. Fountain	Deputy City

Commissioner	Reed Whipple	Attorney	Sidney R. Whitmore

Absent: Commissioner Sharp

In opening the meeting Mayor Gragson reminded those present that the
Board of City Commissioners had agreed not to take any action contrary
to the recommendation of the Planning Commission without first having
a joint meeting to discuss the matter. In response to his call for
comments, Commissioner Whipple said he would like to hear from the
Planning Commission first.

Franklin Bills, Planning Director, said that Mr. Cahlan, Chairman of
the Planning Commission, was unable to be present, but he wanted to
make sure that everyone had the complete background of the requested use.

First Action. This particular piece of property first came to the
Planning Commission with the request that it be zoned C-1 (Commercial)
from R-1 (Residential).

Second Action. The Planning Commission, after the required Public
Hearing, recommended to the City Commission that the property in
question be rezoned C-1 on the findings that it could not be reasonably
used for a single family residence, which was the only use permitted
at that time.

Mr. Bills stated that while the request was in process it was made
clear by the applicant that in the event this Zone Change materialized,
he would submit an application to the Board of Zoning Adjustment for
a Use Permit to put a Service Station thereon.

Third Action. Application for a Use Permit was submitted and heard by
the Board of Zoning Adjustment at a Public Hearing. Four members of
the Board were present. A motion to recommend approval failed to pass.
