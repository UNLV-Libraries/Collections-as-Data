Section 9. The interest falling due on said bonds on October 1, 1947 shall

for such purpose, and there shall be levied in the year 1947 on all property both real
and personal, subject to taxation within the boundaries of said City, including the net
proceeds of mines, a tax sufficient to reimburse said fund or funds for such installment
of interest, and for the purpose of creating a fund for the payment of said bonds and the
interest thereon, there shall be levied in the year 1947 and annually thereafter, a
sufficient tax on all property, both real and personal, subject to taxation within the
boundaries of the City of Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada, including the net proceeds
of mines, sufficient to pay the interest on said bonds and to pay and retire the same
as hereinabove provided; and provided further that in the preparation of annual appropria-
tion ordinance for the City, the City Council shall first make proper provision, through
the levy of sufficient taxes, for the payment of the interest on and the retirement of
the principal of the bonded indebtedness of the City, and the amount of money necessary
for this purpose, together with the amounts necessary for the payment of principal of

Article X of the Constitution of the State of Nevada, and it shall become necessary by
reason thereof to reduce the levies made in behalf of said City, the reductions so made
shall be in taxes levied for or by such City for purposes other than the payment of its
bonded indebtedness and interest thereon, the taxes levied hereafter for the payment of
such bonded indebtedness, and the interest thereon, shall always enjoy a priority over
taxes levied for or on behalf of such City for any other purposes where reduction is
necessary in order to comply with the limitations of said Section 2 of Article X, or with
the City Charter of Las Vegas, Nevada. Such tax shall be levied and collected in the
same manner and at the same time as other taxes are levied and collected, and the proceeds
thereof shall be kept by the County Treasurer in a special fund to be known as the "

payment of principal and interest as the same fall due. Such tax shall be levied in the
year 1947 and annually thereafter until all of said bonds, and the interest thereon,
shall have been fully paid, satisfied and discharged. Any sums coming due on said bonds
at any time when there are on hand from such tax levy or levies, insufficient funds to
pay the same, shall be promptly paid when due from general funds on hand belonging to the
City of Las Vegas, reimbursement to be made to such general funds in the sums thus advanced
when taxes herein provided for shall have been collected.
