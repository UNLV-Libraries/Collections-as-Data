respect the position of my colleague who voted against the revocation of this
license. I think the Child Welfare Board should be commended for the services
they do and this is just one of those times, in other words, a closed book. I
hope the Child Welfare Board will continue in their fine work.

COMM. WHIPPLE:	I thoroughly appreciate the work and hours put in by the Child

Welfare Board. I think you are doing a fine job and will continue

to do so.

MAYOR GRAGSON:	I definitely agree.

JEAN BOMAN:	But why should we continue if these rules are not enforced?

COMM. FOUNTAIN:	It is just one of those things. The hearing is over.

MAYOR GRAGSON:	I am going to say this and I hope that I speak for the entire

Board. This Board cannot and will not permit any infractions on
any licenses; on nursery licenses or any other licenses!

DORIS EVANS:	We appreciate the confidence four of you gave us this afternoon.
