UNITED FUND	City Manager Kennedy presented a letter addressed to the Mayor and Board of City

Fund, requesting a meeting date be set between the Board of City Commissioners and
the United Fund Capital Funds Committee to discuss location of a proposed United
Fund Community Service Building to house participating agencies and other 
community service agencies.

City Manager Kennedy explained that this has reference to 10 acres of City land in
the vicinity of San Francisco and Eastern Avenue as a site for this proposed 
building. He added that the United Fund believed they could build this building and
pay for it by rents that are being paid out for different community functions and
have a very nice building.

Commissioner Sharp suggested that they be familiarized with the laws on the sale
of public land. He also said that it might be possible this particular land might
be unsafe for building. Mr. Kennedy stated that this was not a part of a corner
that has proved dangerous but it is the best comer of the 40 acres.

His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple was of the opinion that the request for this 
meeting should be deferred until a full Board is present, and that Mr. Kennedy should
write a letter to the United Fund to this effect.

Held in Abeyance	continuation of the alley in back of North Main Street between Mesquite and

Bonanza. This appraisal of $3,500.00 by Drury and Associates was directed at the
Commission meeting held December 17, 1958. City Attorney was further instructed
to start condemnation proceedings if this was not acceptable.

Mr. Kennedy stated that this offer had been made and refused by Mr. Clough as he
valued the property at $15,000.00, and he asked the Board if condemnation 
proceedings should be initiated, stating that Drury and Associates would appear as the
appraiser.

Commissioner Fountain asked if this same property was appraised some 7 or 8 years
