Commissioner Whipple stated that after due consideration the Board finds the following
to be facts and therefore moves that the application of Paradise Groves Inc. for rezoning
of Lots 1 to 43 of the proposed Paradise Groves Subdivision from R-l to R-2 be approved:

1,	The development of all areas available with utilities for expansion
with least interference to existing improvements is an immediate
need and constitutes a present emergency.

2.	There is an unliklihood of any development in this area without rezoning,
due to inability for financing R-l next to commercial zoning.

3.	The same type of construction now proposed exists adjacent to the
commercial zone, south of Oakey Boulevard with similar street alignments
and improvements, and constitutes an area in which neither this Board
nor the Public has had any complaints.

4. The development of adjacent areas will be helped rather than hindered
or damaged by approval of this tract.

5. The new plat of adjacent property will provide an adequate system of

connecting streets to main business, school and church sites, and through
arteries.

6. The plan follows principles of good planning within out capacity to realize
at this time.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Peccole and carried by the following vote; Commissioners
Bunker, Peccole, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent: Commissioner
Jarrett.

Commissioner Bunker moved the fee for perpetual care at the Woodlawn Cemetery be increased
