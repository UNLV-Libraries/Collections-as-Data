Said bonds and the interest thereon are payable from a special fund
designated "Sanitary Sewer Improvement Assessment District No. 200-12
Bond Interest and Redemption Fund," containing the receipts upon the
collection thereof from the special assessments levied against and
secured by a lien upon property in Sanitary Sewer Improvement Assess-
ment District No. 200-12 in said City, said assessments bearing in-
terest commencing June 1, 1953, and payable annually on each princi-
pal paying date at the same rate of interest as borne by said bonds,
said assessments being payable in ten substantially equal annual in-
stallments of principal on or before June 1, 1954 and on or before
the same day in each year thereafter until paid in full, or, at the
owner’s option, the whole of the unpaid principal with interest
accruing thereon to the next interest paying date being payable at
any time; provided, however, that in the event said fund shall be
insufficient to pay said bonds and interest thereon as they become
due, the deficiency shall be paid out of the City’s general fund.

Bidders are required to submit a bid specifying (a) the lowest rate of interest
and premium, if any, above par at which the bidder will purchase said bonds; or (b)
the lowest rate of interest at which the bidder will purchase said bonds at par.

All of the bonds shall bear one rate of interest, and said interest shall be
payable by one or more sets of coupons. The bonds will be sold to the bidder
making the best bid, subject to the right of the corporate authorities of the City
of Las Vegas to reject any and all bids and readvertise.

None of said bonds shall be sold at less than par and accrued interest, nor
will any discount or commission be allowed or paid in the sale of such bonds.

All bids shall be sealed and, except the bid of the State of Nevada, shall be
accompanied by a deposit of five percent, either cash or certified check, of the
amount of the bid, which will be returned if the bid is not accepted; and if
the successful bidder shall fail or neglect to complete the purchase of said bonds
within thirty days following the acceptance of his bid, the amount of his deposit
shall be forfeited to the City of Las Vegas, and, in that event, the corporate
authorities of said City may accept the bid of the one making the next best bid,
or if all bids are rejected, such authorities may readvertise said bonds for sale.

If there be two or more equal bids and such bids are the best bids received, and
are not less than par and accrued interest, the corporate authorities will deter-
mine which bid shall be accepted.

The legality of the bonds will be approved by Messrs. Pershing, Bosworth,

Dick and Dawson, Attorney at Law, Denver, Colorado, whose opinion together with
the printed bonds, will be furnished the purchaser without charge.
