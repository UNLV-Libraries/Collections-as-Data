which are of like date and designation and aggregate the total amount of Five Hundred Seventy Seven
Thousand One Hundred Forty-Five and Twenty Three One Hundredths Dollars ($577,145.23).

This bond and the interest thereon shall be payable from a special fund designated "Street
Improvement Assessment District No. 100-36 Bond Interest and Redemption Fund," containing the
receipts upon the collection thereof from the special assessments levied against and secured by a
lien upon property in Street Improvement Assessment District No. 100-36, which fund is and shall con-
tinue to constitute a sinking fund for and be deemed specially appropriated to the full and prompt
payment of said bonds and the interest thereon, and shall be used for no other purpose whatever,
provided, however, that in the event said fund shall be insufficient to pay said bonds and the interest
as they become due, the deficiency shall be paid out of the City's general fund.

Said special assessments made and levied to defray said cost, with accruing interest thereon,
constitute a lien upon and against the property upon which such assessments were made and levied
from and after the 15th day of February, 1956 the date upon which the amended assessment roll therefor
was confirmed and approved by the Board of Commissioners of said City.

It is hereby certified, recited and declared that all acts, conditions and things essential
to the validity of the bond exist, have happened and have been done in due time, from and manner
as required by law, and that the total issue of said improvement bonds of said City for said im-
provements and incidental expenses, including this bond, does not exceed the amount authorized by
law nor the special assessments levied to cover the cost of said improvements.

It is hereby further certified, recited and declared that the proceedings, with reference to
making such improvements and levying the assessments to pay therefor, have been regularly had and
taken in compliance with law, and that all prerequisites to the fixing of the assessment lien against
the property benefited by the improvements and of the personal liability of the owner or owners of
such property therefor have been performed.

This bond is subject to the condition, and every holder hereof by accepting the same agrees
with the obligor and every subsequent holder hereof, that (a) the delivery of this bond to the
transferee shall vest title in this bond and in the interest coupons attached hereto in such trans-
feree to the same extent for all purposes as would the delivery under like circumstances of any
negotiable instrument payable to bearer; (b) the obligor and any agent of the obligor may treat
the bearer of this bond as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, and shall not be affected
by any notice to the contrary; (c) the principal of and the interest on this bond shall be paid, and
this bond and each of the coupons appertaining thereto are transferable, free from and without regard
to any equities between the obligor and the original or any intermediate holder hereof, or any set-
offs or cross-claims; and (d) the surrender to the obligor or any agent of the obligor of this bond
and each of the coupons shall be a good discharge to the obligor for the same.
