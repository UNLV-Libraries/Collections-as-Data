this problem.

City Attorney Howard W. Cannon stated that he did not have the final inform-
ation to report on the status of Assessment District No. 100-25. He reported

schedule so that the City's contract on the improvement of Fifth Street will
be separate.

City Engineer George Wade gave a report on the status of the improvements in

Paradise Village Tracts Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4. He stated that all the tracts

were almost complete with the exception of small items that should be taken care of.

The City Attorney gave a report on the sewer contract with North Las Vegas. It
was determined that this contract should be studied and at a future date that
North Las Vegas should be called in to renegotiate the contract.

Discussion was held on the sewer contract with the 'Strip Hotels," and it was
reported that this contract expired on the 30th of June, 1954. The City Attorney
was directed to write a letter to these hotels advising them of this fact. Authority
was given to bill the hotels for the six months' period from July through December
at the rate of $ .324 per fixture.
