ORDINANCE NO. 447

AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND ORDINANCE NO. 203 OF THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS AS AMENDED, ENTITLED:	"AN ORDINANCE REGU-

LATING THE DISTRIBUTION AND CONTROL OF INTOXICATING AND ALCOHOLIC LIQUORS AND BEVERAGES: REGULATING PLACES
WHERE AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS SAID INTOXICATING AND ALCOHOLIC LIQUORS AND BEVERAGES MAY BE KEPT, SOLD, AND
GIVEN AWAY OR OTHERWISE DISTRIBUTED, PROVIDING FOR PERMITS AND LICENSES; PROVIDING PENALTIES FOR THE VIOLA-
TION OF THIS ORDINANCE; AND REPEALING ALL ORDINANCES OR PARTS OF ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT WITH THIS ORDINANCE."
ALSO REFERRED TO AS CHAPTER 16 OF THE LAS VEGAS CITY CODE.

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, at a recessed regular meet-
ing thereof, held on the 28th day of March, 1946, duly adopted a Resolution establishing a policy in respect
to the issuance of tavern and liquor store licenses, thereby the number of such licenses issued would be
based on population and limited to one liquor store license to each 1000 population, and one tavern license
to each 1000 population, and

WHEREAS, the number of such licenses already issued at the time of the adoption of said Resolution
were in excess of the limitation established by said Resolution as based on the population at that time, and

WHEREAS, investigation and experience has since disclosed that such allocation of liquor license
is fair and impartial, and to the best interests of the people of Las Vegas, and

WHEREAS, said Board feels justified in deviating from this rule of allocation only in respect to
licenses for taverns to be operated as part of and in connection with hotels wherein substantial monetary
investments are made, and will consider favorably applications for licenses in such circumstances only, and

WHEREAS, said Board is conscious of its moral responsibility to so administer the liberal laws of
the State of Nevada, as they pertain to the City of Las Vegas, as to justify their continued existence, and

WHEREAS, it has been determined by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas that the
interests of the public would be better served by basing the number of tavern and retail liquor licenses
issued on population, limiting one retail liquor license to each 1000 population and one tavern liquor li-
cense to each 1000 population,

NOW, THEREFORE, THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS, NEVADA DOES ORDAIN;

Section 1. Ordinance No. 203 of the City of Las Vegas, as amended, also known as Chapter 16 of
the Las Vegas City Code, is hereby amended by adding the following:

Hereafter, tavern liquor and retail liquor licenses shall be
based on population, limiting the number of licenses issued to
one tavern liquor license to each 1000 population in the City
of Las Vegas, and one retail liquor license to each 1000 popu-
lation in the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, provided, however,
that hotels with 50 rooms or more are exempt from the provisions
of this section.

If any license provided for in this section should be revoked
for any reason, no new license shall be issued until the popu-
lation of the City of Las Vegas is such that the terms of this
