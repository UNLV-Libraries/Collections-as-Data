R E S O L U T I O N

Under Public Law #139, signed by the President last week, it appears
	that outright grants of federal funds may be available for certain purposes

in officially-declared defense areas.

Among these purposes are housing and water facilities.

Inasmuch as both of these rank high on the development agenda of this
community, we deem it important that the possibilities of securing federal
funds to assist our area in coping with its housing and water problems be
thoroughly canvassed.

To that end we ask that the Las Vegas Nevada Chamber of Commerce
communicate on our behalf with the office of the Administrator, Housing
and Home Finance Agency, asking that an official survey be made to deter-
mine whether this area may qualify for federal funds for its housing and
water problems under the terms of Public Law #139.
