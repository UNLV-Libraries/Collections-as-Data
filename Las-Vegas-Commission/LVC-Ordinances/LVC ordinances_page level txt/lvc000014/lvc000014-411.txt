rates shall be effective upon the publication and final passage of this Ordinance, said publication to be made
immediately following the first reading and approval of the Ordinance. The City covenants and agrees that while
any of said bonds are outstanding, it will from time to time revise and adjust said schedule of rates to the
end that the revenue and income derived from the operation of the system will be sufficient to pay all opera-
ting and maintenance charges and both the principal of and the interest on the bonds authorized by Ordinance
No. 353, duly adopted on the 23rd day of April, 1948, as amended and supplemented. The City further covenants
that no free service shall be furnished by the system provided, however, that no charge will be made to the
United States of America, the State of Nevada, the County of Clark or any charitable institution for the direct
use by it of said system.

Section 2. Section 4 of the above entitled Ordinance No. 364 is hereby amended to read as follows:

Section 4. All bills for services rendered by or through said system shall be rendered quarterly in
advance on the first days of January, April, July and October of each year. In the event said bills are not
paid in full within twenty days (20) after the date when rendered, service shall be discontinued and thereafter
no sewer connection which has been disconnected for the non-payment of charges shall again be reconnected while
the property is in the same ownership until all costs incurred in the actual physical disconnection and recon-
nection have been paid and all delinquent sewage service charges have been paid to the City of Las Vegas. Pay-
ment of all bills rendered shall be made into the City Treasury and such bills may be paid annually in advance
and provided further that no license shall be granted for the conducting of any business requiring a city
license in any multiple dwelling or place of business unless the quarterly charge for the sewer service is paid
in advance. The sewer service charges fixed by Section 3 hereof shall be payable quarterly in advance, and shall
constitute a debt and obligation of the owner of the improved property, whose industrial, business or residential
establishment is connected to the Municipal Sewage Disposal System, to the City of Las Vegas, and said owner
shall be liable therefor in any action commenced by the City for the recovery of said charges in any court of
competent jurisdiction.

Section 3. That all ordinances or parts of ordinances inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed to
the extent only of such inconsistency. This repealer shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part of
any ordinance heretofore repealed.

Section 4. This ordinance shall be in full force and effect upon its publication, as in the next
section provided, and final passage.

Section 5. The City Clerk and Clerk of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas shall
