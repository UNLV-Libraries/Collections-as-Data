RESOLUTION NO. 100

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, at a recessed
regular meeting thereof held on the 28th day of March, 1946, duly adopted a Resolution
establishing a policy in respect to the issuance of tavern and liquor store licenses,
whereby the number of such licenses issued would be based on population and limited to one
liquor store license to each 1000 population, and one tavern license to each 1000 population,
and

WHEREAS, the number of such licenses already issued at the time of the adoption of
said Resolution wore in excess of the limitation established by said Resolution as based
on the population at that time, and

WHEREAS, investigation and experience has since disclosed that such allocation of
liquor licenses is fair and impartial, and is the same method employed by our neighboring
states in this regard, and

WHEREAS, said Board feels justified in deviating from this rule of allocation only
in respect to licenses for taverns to be operated as part of and in connection with hotels
wherein substantial monetary investments are made, and will consider favorably appli-
cations for licenses in such circumstances only, and

WHEREAS, said Board is conscious of its moral responsibility to so administer the
liberal laws of the State of Nevada, as they pertain to the City of Las Vegas, as to
justify their continued existence.

NOW, THEREFORE, be it resolved, this 27th day of June, 1947, by the Board of Com-
missioners of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, that the Resolution duly adopted by said
Board on the 28th day of March, 1946, and the declaration of policy therein contained,
and as hereinabove restated, relative to the limitation on the issuance of liquor store
licenses and tavern licenses, be and the same are hereby ratified and reaffirmed and that
said Resolution and declaration of policy, as hereinabove restated, shall continue in full
force and effect.
