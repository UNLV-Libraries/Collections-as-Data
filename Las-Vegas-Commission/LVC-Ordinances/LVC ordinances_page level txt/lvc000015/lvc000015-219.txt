Nevada, within ten days after said special assessment roll is confirmed and approved, without interest and

be paid in installments, with interest, as hereinafter provided. Failure to pay the whole assessment, or any
part thereof, within said period of ten days shall be conclusively considered and held an election on the
 part of all persons interested, whether under disability or otherwise, to pay in such installments. In case
 of such election to pay in installments, the unpaid assessments shall be payable at the office of said Ex-
officio City Treasurer in ten substantially equal annual installments of principal. The first of which install-
ments of principal shall be due and payable on or before the 1st day of May, 195k, and the remainder of said
installments shall be due and payable successively on or before the same day in each year thereafter until
paid in full, with interest in all cases on the unpaid and deferred installments of principal from the 1st
day of May, 1953 at the same rate of interest as that provided for in the special assessment bond to be
hereafter authorized, sold, issued and delivered, but not to exceed seven per centum (7%) per annum, payable
annually at the office of said Ex-officio City Treasurer, the first annual payment of interest being due and
payable on the said 1st day of May, 1954, and the remainder of said annual installments of interest being due
and payable on the 1st day of May in each year thereafter. Failure to pay any installment, whether of princi-
pal or interest, when due, shall cause the whole of the unpaid principal to become due and payable immediately,
and the whole amount of the unpaid principal and accrued interest shall thereafter bear penalty at the rate
of ten per centum per annum, until the day of sale, but at any time prior to the day of the sale, the owner
may pay the amount of all unpaid installments, with interest thereon at ten per centum per annum, and all
penalties accrued, and shall thereupon be restored to the right thereafter to pay in installments in the
same manner as if default had not been suffered. The owner of any property not in default as to any install-
