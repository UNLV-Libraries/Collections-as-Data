ORDINANCE NO. 386	An ordinance entitled: AN ORDINANCE AUTHORIZING AND DIRECTING THE EX-OFFICIO CITY ASSESSOR

Lighting	TO DEFRAY THE COSTS OF MAKING CERTAIN IMPROVEMENTS IN THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS, BY INSTALLING

STREETS AND portion OF STREETS IN SAID CITY; THE COST AND EXPENSES THEREOF SHALL BE PAID

DEFINITELY THE LOCATION OF SAID IMPROVEMENTS, STATING THE amount OF THE SAID ASSESSMENT
AND DESIGNATING THE LOCALITY CONSTITUTING THE DISTRICT TO BE ASSESSED ACCORDING TO THE
BENEFITS, AND OTHER MATTERS RELATING THERETO, having been referred on July 7, 1949, to
Commissioners Bunker and Peccole for report, this committee submitted the following recom-
mendation;

"Your committee is of the opinion that the ordinance as prepared is appropriate
and that as a practical business matter it is the duty and obligation of the
City Commission to enact it forthwith and then to see that it becomes operative
in fact, through the proper channels, immediately thereafter.

Your committee is forced to make the following observations based upon inform-
ation and data which came to its attention in the course of its investigation.

It has not been possible yet to ascertain the date upon which completion of this
work was effected - the work order indicates July 7, 1948, the records or recol-
lection of the City Manager's office indicate some date in 1947 and the records
or recollection of the City Light Department Manager, which did the work, indi-
cates another date in 1947. Perhaps this might not be felt important in the
ultimate but it would seem to indicate some lack of coordination between the
functioning bodies of the city which were involved in this project; then again,
a disparity of a year might make a considerable complication to many citizens of
the affected area as hereinafter pointed out.

The work on this project was apparently duly authorized by Ordinance No. 318,
enacted July 22, 1946 and it ultimately involved a considerable expenditure of
labor, material and management, mainly on the part of the City Electric Department
as witness by the final cost bill of $18, 263.94.

This work was completed as above stated at an indeterminate date sometime between
1947 and 1948 or over a year or possibly over two years ago and it is now difficult
for your committee to understand why assessment against the properties and sub-
sequent collection of the amounts due have been so long deferred. In the interim
many properties in the affected areas have changed hands, some no doubt more than
once, and in all such instances, it seems safe to assume, without notice by the
purchasers of any outstanding charges for the work done in this project; it will
no doubt be more difficult for these newer owners to understand why they are now
being assessed for improvements created for one or two years prior to their ac-
quisition of the properties.

The first and only indication of any affirmative action looking toward collection
	of these charges that your committee has been able to find was when the City Comp-

troller is September of 1948 referred the matter to the former City Attorney where
the matter seems to have rested.

Considering the known fact that the City has been under great financial pressure
during the period involved herein and without considering the inconvenience and
possible injustice assessment at this late date may inflict, it seems strange, to
your committee that an account receivable of such size should have been permitted
to hang in suspension and inactive for so long a period without any effort at col-
lection, and that it will cause a considerable disaffection on those now to be
assessed.
