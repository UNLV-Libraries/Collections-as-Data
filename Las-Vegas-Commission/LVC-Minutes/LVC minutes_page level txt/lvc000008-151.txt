shall continue to constitute a sinking fund for and be deemed specially appropriated to

the full and prompt payment of said bonds and the interest thereon, and shall be used for
no other purpose whatever, provided, however, that in the event said fund shall be in-
sufficient to pay said bonds and the interest thereon as they become due, the deficiency
shall be paid out of the City's general fund.

Said special assessments made and levied to defray said cost, with securing interest
thereon, constitute a lien upon and against the property upon which such assessments were
made and levied from and after the 13th day of June 1952 the date upon which the Assessment
Roll therefor was confirmed and approved by the Board of Commissioners of said City.

It is hereby certified, recired and declared that all acts, conditions and things
essential to the validity of the bond exist, have happened and have been done in due time,
form and manner as required by law, and that the total issue of said City for said improve-
ments and incidental expenses, including this bond, does not exceed the amount authorized
by law nor the special assessments levied to cover the cost of said improvements.

It is hereby further certified, recited and declared that the proceedings, with refer-
ence to making such improvements and levying the assessments to pay therefor, have been regularly
had and taken in compliance with law, and that all prerequisites to the fixing of the assessment
lien against the property benefited by the improvements and of the personal liability of the
owner or owners of such property therefor have been performed.

This bond is subject to the condition, and every holder hereof by accepting the same agrees
with the obligor and every subsequent holder hereof, that (a) the delivery of this bond to the
transferee shall best title in this bond and in the interest coupons attached hereto in such
transferee to the same extent for all purposes as would the delivery under like circumstances
of any negotiable instrument payable to bearer; (b) the obligor and any agent of the obligor
may treat the bearer of this bond as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, and shall
not be affected by any notice to the contrary; (c) the principal of and the interest on this
bond shall be paid, and this bond and each of the coupons appertaining thereto are transferable,
free from and without regard to any equities between the obligor and the original or any inter-
mediate holder hereof, or any set-offs or cross-claims; and (d) the surrender to the obligor
or any agent of the obligor or any agent of the obligor of this bond and each of the coupons
shall be a good discharge to the obligor for the same.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, has caused this bond to be signed by its
Mayor, countersigned by its City Treasurer, and its corporate seal to be affixed hereto and attested and countersigned by its City Clerk, and the annexed coupons to bear the facsimile signatures of
