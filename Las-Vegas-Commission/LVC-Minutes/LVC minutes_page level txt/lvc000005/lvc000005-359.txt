7, 1945, and,

WHEREAS, certain obligations have been incurred in connection with 

sidewalk demands, fire department, planning commissioner, and preliminary work
on assessment districts. Funds for which were not provided in the regular
budget and for which reimbursement cannot be obtained within the Budget Year,
and,

WHEREAS, unforeseen expenses in connection with the 1945 election, the
policing of the City, and the feeding of prisoners, and the repairing of
City owned equipment, costs of which could not be properly determined at the
time the current budget was prepared, and,

WHEREAS, the only means possible to meet these obligations and 

expenditures is through the securing of an emergency loan, funds for which are
available in the unappropriated surplus account of the general fund of the City
of Las Vegas,
