Step No. 3 would be the extension of the proposed highway from the point where J Street
intersects the northerly city limits, thence running eastward, extending said highway
to connect with Main Street at the approximate point where Main Street intersects with
the northern limits of the City of Las Vegas, this proposed step to be completed at
some convenient time in the future.

II.     That portion of the Zaugg Tract lying east of J Street to be rezoned from R-E to R-1;
that portion of the Zaugg Tract lying west of J Street to remain zoned as at present,
that is, R-E; that portion of the Zaugg Tract lying between J Street and K Street to
be additionally restricted by an amendment to the zoning ordinance providing that no
residence may be constructed in said area having square footage of less than 1,000
sq. ft., exclusive of carports, garages and other residential building appurtenances;
also, that portion of the Zaugg Tract lying between K Street and Highland Avenue
to be additionally restricted by amendment to the zoning ordinance to provide that no
dwelling may be constructed thereon having less than 1200 sq. ft. of area, exclusive of garages,
carports and other residential appurtenances.

 That the zone change in regard to the so-called Harper property being requested by the City
Housing Authority be granted to permit this particular twenty acre tract to be rezoned to R-2.

III.  That on the occasion of the next vacancy in the City Housing Authority that the City Commis-
sion give consideration to  the appointment of some resident of the areas affected by the
location of the Public Housing project.

IV. That the office of the City Attorney be directed to proceed immediately to abate all of those
structures now on the Zaugg Tract, which have been built in violation of the zoning laws, or
which have been built in violation of the zoning laws, or which may be existing at the pre-
sent time under conditions constituting, a nuisance; that the City Attorney's office be in-
structed to give special attention to this particular property with a view to eliminating
all sub-standard shacks from the Zaugg Tract.

V.   That the Office of the City Building Inspector be given specific instructions strictly to
enforce the zoning regulations, with reference to the Zaugg Tract, and to make periodic
inspections to make certain said city zoning laws are being enforced.

It is the concensus of opinion among the members of your committee that the zoning laws in
this section have not in the past been strictly enforced, and that this has resulted in much
dissatisfaction on the part of citizens of Las Vegas residing in Bonanza Village and on West
Bonanza Road.
