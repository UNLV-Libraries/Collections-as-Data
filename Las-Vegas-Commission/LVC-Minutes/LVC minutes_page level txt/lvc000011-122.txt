The City of Las Vegas, in the County of Clark and State of Nevada, a
municipal corporation duly organized and existing, for value received hereby
promises, out of funds available for the purpose, as hereinafter set forth, to
pay to bearer hereof the principal sum of

One Thousand dollars

Four Hundred dollars

Five Hundred Forty-six and thirty-one one hundredths dollars

on the first day of May, 1959; with interest thereon until maturity according to
the interest coupons and thereafter until paid at the rate of Three and three-
quarters percentum (3-3/4%) per annum, payable annually on the first day of May
in each year, both principal and interest being payable in lawful money of the
United States of America, at the office of the City Treasurer, City of Las Vegas,
Clark County, Nevada, upon presentation and surrender of this bond and of the 
annexed coupons as they severally become due.

This bond is subject to redemption at the option of the City of Las
Vegas on any interest payment date at a price equal to the principal amount thereof
with accrued interest to the redemption date. Redemption shall be made upon not
less than fifteen days' prior notice by publication in a newspaper of general 
circulation in the City of Las Vegas in the manner and upon the conditions provided in
the ordinance authorizing the issuance of this bond.

This bond is one of a series of 110 special assessment, negotiable coupon, 
improvement bonds, numbered consecutively from one to 110, both inclusive, issued 
by the City of Las Vegas, all of which are of like date and designation and
aggregate the total amount of One Hundred Four Thousand One Hundred Forty-six and
Thirty-one One Hundredths Dollars ($104,146.31).

This bond and the interest thereon shall be payable from a special fund
designated "Street Improvement Assessment District No. 100-35 Bond Interest and
Redemption Fund," containing the receipts upon the collection thereof from the
special assessments levied against and secured by a lien upon property in Street
Improvement Assessment District No. 100-35; which fund is and shall continue to
constitute a sinking fund for and be deemed specially appropriate to the full and
prompt payment of said bonds and the interest thereon, and shall be used for no
other purpose whatever, provided, however, that in the event said funds shall be
insufficient to pay said bonds and the interest thereon as they become due, the
deficiency shall be paid out of the City's general fund.

Said special assessments made and levied to defray said cost, with 
accruing interest thereon, constitute a lien upon and against the property upon
which such assessments were made and levied from and after the 7th day of March,

1958 the date upon which the assessment roll therefor was confirmed and approved
by the Board of Commissioners of said City.

It is hereby certified, recited and declared that all acts, conditions
and things essential to the validity of the bond exist, have happened and have
been done in due time, form and manner as required by law, and that the total 
issue of said improvement bonds of said City for said improvements and incidental
expenses, including this bond, does not exceed the amount authorized by law nor
the special assessments levied to cover the cost of said improvements.

It is hereby further certified, recited and declared that the proceedings, 
with reference to making such improvements and levying the assessments to
pay therefor, have been regularly had and taken in compliance with law, and that
all prerequisites to the fixing of the assessment lien against the property benefited 
by the improvements and of the personal liability of the owner or owners of
such property therefor have been performed.

This bond is subject to the condition, and every holder hereof by 
accepting the same agrees with the obligor and every subsequent holder hereof, that
(a) the delivery of this bond to the transferee shall vest title in this bond
and in the interest coupons attached hereto in such transferee to the same extent
 for all purposes as would the delivery under like circumstances of any negotiable 
instrument payable to bearer; (b) the obligor and any agent of the obligor
may treat the bearer of this bond as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes,
and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary; (c) the principal of
and the interest on this bond shall be paid, and this bond and each of the coupons
appertaining thereto are transferable, free from and without regard to any equities
between the obligor and the original or any intermediate holder hereof, or any
set-offs or cross claims;
