The City shall distribute the Payments in Lieu of Taxes among the Taxing Bodies
in the proportion which the real property taxes which would have been paid to each Taxing
Body for such year if the Project were not exempt from taxation bears to the total real
property taxes which would have been paid to all of the Taxing Bodies for such year if the
Project were not exempt from taxation; provided, however, that no payment for any year
shall be made to any Taxing Body (including the City) in excess of the amount of the real
property taxes which would have been paid to such Taxing Body for such year if the Project
were not exempt from taxation.

4. The City agrees that, subsequent to the date of initiation (as defined in
the Act) of each Project and within five years after the completion thereof, or such further
period as may be approved by the PHA, there has been or will be elimination (as approved by
the PHA) by demolition, condemnation, effective closing, or compulsory repair or improvement,
of unsafe or insanitary dwelling units situated in the City not less in number than the number of
newly constructed dwelling units provided by such Project; provided, that, where more than
one family is living in an unsafe or insanitary dwelling unit, the elimination of such unit
shall count as the elimination of units equal to the number of families accommodated therein;
and provided, further, that this paragraph 4 shall not apply in the case of any Project
developed on the site of a Slum cleared subsequent to July 15, 1949, and that the dwelling
units eliminated by the clearance of the site of such Project shall not be counted as elimination
for any other Project or any other low-rent housing project.

force and effect, or (c) any bonds issued in connection with such Project shall remain out-
standing, whichever period is the longest, the City without cost or charge to the Local

as it may be necessary, all public or private utility lines and

able and necessary for the development and protection thereof;

(d)	accept grants of easements necessary for the development of such
Projects; and

(e)	cooperate with the Local Authority by such other lawful action or
ways as the City and the Local Authority may find necessary in

time after receipt of a written request therefor from the Local Authority;

the grading, improvement, and paving thereof in accordance with
specifications acceptable to the City; and

(b)	it will accept necessary dedications of land for, and will grade,
improve, pave, and provide sidewalks for, all streets bounding
such Project or necessary to provide adequate access thereto (in
consideration whereof the Local Authority shall pay to the City

such amount as would be assessed against the Project site for such	

work if it were privately owned); and

(c)	it will provide, or cause to be provided, water mains, and storm	

and sanitary sewer mains, leading to such Project and serving the
bounding streets thereof (in consideration whereof the Local

Authority shall pay to the City such amount as would be assessed

7.	If the City shall, within a reasonable time after written notice from the
Authority, fail or refuse to furnish or cause to be furnished any of the services or

any Project, then the Local facilities which it is obligated hereunder to furnish or cause to be furnished to the Local Authority or to
Authority may proceed to	such services or facilities elsewhere, and deduct the coat therefor from any Payments in

obtain/ Lieu of Taxes due or to become due to the City in respect to any Project or any other
