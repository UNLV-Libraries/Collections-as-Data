payable in lawful money of the United States of America, at the office of the City Treasurer, City of Las Vegas,
dark County, Nevada, upon presentation and surrender of this bond and of the annexed coupons as they severally

This bond is subject to redemption at the option of the City of Las Vegas on any interest payment date at
a price equal to the principal amount thereof with accrued interest to the redemption date. Redemption shall be
made upon not less than fifteen days' prior notice by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the City
of Las Vegas in the manner and upon the conditions provided in the ordinance authorizing the issuance of this bond.

This bond is one of a series of 70 special assessment, negotiable coupon, improvement bonds numbered
consecutively from one to 70, both inclusive, issued by the City of Las Vegas, all of which are of like date and
designation and aggregate the total amount of Sixty-Two Thousand Five Hundred Thirty-Three & Twenty-Eight One
Hundredths Dollars ($62,533.28).

This bond and the interest thereon shall be payable from a special fund designated "Assessment District
No. 100-25" Street Improvement Bond Interest and Redemption Fund", containing the receipts upon the collection
thereof from the special assessments levied against and secured by a lien upon property in Street Improvement
Assessment District No. 100-25, which fund is and shall continue to constitute a sinking fund for and be deemed
specially appropriated to the full and prompt payment of said bonds and the interest thereon, and shall be used
for no other purpose whatever, provided, however, that in the event said fund shall be insufficient to pay said
bonds and the interest thereon as they become due, the deficiency shall be paid out of the City's general fund.

Said special assessments made and levied to defray said cost, with accruing interest thereon, constitute
a lien upon and against the property upon which such assessments were made and levied from and after the 16th day
of February, 1955; the date upon which the amended assessment roll therefor was confirmed and approved by the
Board of Commissioners of said City.

It is hereby certified, recited and declared that all acts, conditions and things essential to the
validity of the bond exist, have happened and have been done in due time, form and manner as required by law, and
that the total issue of said improvement bonds of said City for said improvements and incidental expenses, includ-
ing this bond, does not exceed the amount authorized by law nor the special assessments levied to cover the cost
of said improvements.

It is hereby further certified, recited and declared that the proceedings with reference to making such
improvements and levying the assessments to pay therefore have been regularly had and taken in compliance with law,
and that all prerequisites to the fixing of the assessment lien against the property benefited by the improvements
and of the personal liability of the owner or owners of such property therefor have been performed.

This bond is subject to the condition, and every holder hereof by accepting the same agrees with the
obligor and every subsequent holder hereof, that (a) the delivery of this bond to any transferee shall vest title
in this bond and in the interest coupons attached hereto in such transferee to the same extent for all purposes as
would the delivery under like circumstances of any negotiable instrument payable to bearer; (b) the obligor and
any agent of the obligor may treat the bearer of this bond as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, and shall
not be affected by any notice to the contrary; (c) the principal of and the interest on this bond shall be paid,
and this bond and each of the coupons appertaining thereto are transferable, free from and without regard to any
equities between the obligor and the original or any intermediate holder hereof, or any set-offs or cross-claims;
and (d) the surrender to the obligor or any agent of the obligor of this bond and each of the coupons shall be
a good discharge to the obligor for the same.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, has caused this bond to be signed by its Mayor,
countersigned by its City Treasurer, and its corporate seal to be affixed hereto and attested and countersigned
by its City Clerk, and the annexed coupons to bear the facsimile signatures of said officials, and this bond to
