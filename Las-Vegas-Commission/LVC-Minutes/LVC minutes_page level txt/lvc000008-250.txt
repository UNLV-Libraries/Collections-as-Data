This being the time heretofore set for the rehearing on the application of Paradise

given an opportunity to speak.

Those who appeared and spoke on behalf of the proposed rezoning were:

Madison Graves, representing Paradise Groves Inc.

William J. Moore

R.J. Kaltenborn

There were also a number of property owners living in the vicinity who opposed this
rezoning because there was no through street from this proposed subdivision to South
5th Street.

Thereafter the Board announced that they would take this matter under consideration
and announce their decision at a future time. At this time Commissioner Whipple
left the meeting.

This being the time set for the Public Hearing on the application of George Scully

Dwelling) Use District to R-4 (Apartment) Use District, His Honor asked if there
