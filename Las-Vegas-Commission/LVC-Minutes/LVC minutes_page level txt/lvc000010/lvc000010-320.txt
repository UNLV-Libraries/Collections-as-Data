Planning Director Franklin Bills presented a resolution requesting the reservation of
capital grant funds and approving the undertaking of surveys and plans for an urban renewal
project. Mr. Bills explained that this resolution also authorized the filing of an appli-
cation for federal advance of funds. He briefly outlined that the cost of preparing surveys
and plans for the urban renewal project on the Westside of Las Vegas was estimated at
$54,177.00. He further stated that the application requests the Government to reserve
capital grant funds for the proposed project in an amount not to exceed $694,000.00.

Thereafter Commissioner Bunker moved that the following resolution be adopted and the Mayor
and Clerk authorized to sign said application for an advance of funds from the U.S. Govern-
ment for the surveys and plans for the City of Las Vegas urban renewal project:
