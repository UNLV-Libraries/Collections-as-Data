Commissioner Jarrett then asked if there were any objections to this rezoning from the
floor.

Mr. Herb Jones stated that he felt the town should keep up with the growth in population,
but was not a strenuous objector.

The vote was then taken on the motion that this proposed change of zone be denied.
Commissioners Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, Commissioner Jarrett.

Jarrett stated that there were too many liquor places at the present time.

This being the time heretofore set for a public hearing on the proposed ordinance on
height regulation with Nellis Air Force Base; the title of which is as follows:	AN

ORDINANCE REGULATING THE HEIGHT OF STRUCTURES AND OBJECTS OF NATURAL GROWTH, AND OTHERWISE
REGULATING THE USE OF PROPERTY WITHIN THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS, NEAR THE VICINITY OF NELLIS
AIR FORCE BASE, CLARK COUNTY, NEVADA, BY CREATING HEIGHT LIMITING ZONES AND ESTABLISHING THE
BOUNDARIES THEREOF; PROVIDING FOR CHANGES IN THE RESTRICTIONS AND BOUNDARIES OF SUCH
ZONES; DEFINING CERTAIN TERMS USED HEREIN; PROVIDING FOR ENFORCEMENT; ESTABLISHING METHODS
AND PROCEDURES; IMPOSING PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS; AND PROVIDING OTHER MATTERS RELATING
THERETO.

Commissioner Sharp asked if there were any objections to this proposed ordinance and
there were none.

Commissioner Jarrett moved that this ordinance be adopted and numbered 619.

Commissioner Sharp seconded the motion which was carried by the following vote:

Commissioners Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Baker voting aye; noes, none.
Absent:	Commissioner Bunker.

This being the time heretofore set for a report from Commissioners Jarrett and Whipple on the
proposed resumption of license fee for the Southern Nevada Disposal Company, the committee
asked that this matter be held in abeyance until the next regular meeting.

This being the time heretofore set for the award of the bid on the Moveable Bleachers for
the City Recreation Center, the Director of Public Works recommended that the bid of the
Wayne Iron Works in the amount of $20,518.00 be approved.

Mr. Wade stated that the bid of Marston Supply Company was lower; however, their bleachers
are 4'2" wide while Wayne Iron Works are 2'll" and as the City is limited for space, he
feels that the bid of Wayne Iron Works would be more advantageous to the City.

The Commission discussed the matter of funds for this project, and it was decided to defer
this matter for the time being.

This being the time heretofore set to award the Bid on the Water Softener for the Police
Department, this matter was deferred until later in the year as A. H. Kennedy's budget will
not take this expenditure at the present time.

Mr. George Wade at this time stated that this bid would have to be deferred as it was
found after checking the plans that it will he necessary to move the pumping plant
approximately 400 feet from the spot picked by the Commission. This will cost
approximately $1500.00 to grade with a saving of $750.00 on the other end of the line.
However, the bidders will proceed with the work at the unt price they submitted.

Mr. Wade stated that this award of bid must also be deferred as it is in connection with
Schedule D Sewer.
