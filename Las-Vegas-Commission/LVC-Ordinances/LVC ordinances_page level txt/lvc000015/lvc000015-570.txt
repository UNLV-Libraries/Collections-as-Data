WHEREAS, the assessment roll cannot be confirmed until some time during the

WHEREAS, because of such circumstance the annual installments of principal

NOW, THEREFORE, the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas does

SECTION 1. Section 15 of Ordinance 758 is hereby amended to read as follows:

That said assessments shall be due and payable at the office of the County
Treasurer of Clark County, Nevada, Acting Ex-Officio City Treasurer and Ex-Officio Tax
Collector of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, within four weeks after said special assess-
ment roll is confirmed and approved, without interest and without demand; provided, that
all such assessments, or any part thereof, may, at the election of the owner, be paid in
installments, with interest, as hereinafter provided. Failure to pay the whole assess-
ment, or any part thereof, within said period of four weeks shall be conclusively con-
sidered and held an election on the part of all persons interested, whether under dis-
ability or otherwise, to pay in such installments. In case of such election to pay in
installments, the unpaid assessments shall be payable at the office of said Ex-Officio
City Treasurer in ten substantially equal annual installments of principal, the first of
which installments of principal shall be due and payable on or before the 1st day of
April, 1959, and the remainder of said installments shall be due and payable succes-
sively on or before the same day in each year thereafter until paid in full, with in-
terest in all cases on the unpaid deferred installments of principal from the 1st day
of April, 1958, at the same rate of interest as that provided for in the special assess-
ment bond to be hereafter authorized, sold, issued and delivered, but not to exceed
seven per centum (7%) per annum, payable annually at the office of said Ex-Officio City
  Treasurer, the first annual payment of interest being due and payable on the 1st day of
  April, 1959, and the remainder of said annual installments of interest being due and
payable on the 1st day of April in each year thereafter. Failure to pay any install-
  ment, whether of principal or interest, when due, shall cause the whole of the unpaid
principal to become due and payable immediately, and the whole amount of the unpaid
  principal and accrued interest shall thereafter bear penalty at the rate of ten per
centum (10%) per annum, until the day of sale, but at any time prior to the day of the
sale, the owner may pay the amount of all unpaid installments, with interest thereon
  at ten per centum (10%) per annum, and all penalties accrued, and shall thereupon be
  restored to the right thereafter to pay in installments in the same manner as if de-
fault had not been suffered. The owner of any property not in default as to any in-

  stallment or payment, may, at any time, pay the whole of the unpaid principal with
