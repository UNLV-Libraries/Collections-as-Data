shall be paid by special assessment to be made according to the benefits against the owners
and upon the taxable lots and premises embraced within the special assessment district as
created by Ordinance #400, Diagrams and estimates of cost are on file in the office of the
City Clerk.

The Board has set Monday, the 27th day of February, 1950, at the hour of 3:00 P.M.,
as the time for the hearing of suggestions and/or objections that may be made by parties in
interest to the proposed improvements, said hearing to be held in the Council Chambers in
  the City Hall at the corner of Stewart and Fifth Streets, in the City of Las Vegas, Nevada.

Dated this 8th day of February, 1950.

His Honor asked if there was any one present who wished to offer suggestions or objections
to this assessment district.

Mr. Sherman Mason representing the McNeil Construction Co, asked the Board to consider his
petition to include the McNeil Tract in this assessment district.

His Honor told Mr. Mason that the City Attorney had advised the Board that in order to in-
clude the McNeil Tract in this assessment district it would necessitate the starting on
proceedings from the beginning.

After discussion was held Commissioner Moore moved that the City Engineer be instructed to
work on another improvement district for the installation of sewers in the McNeill Tract
and properties south, and north of Charleston Boulevard on a benefit rather than a frontage
basis.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Bunker, Moore, Peccole, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.
