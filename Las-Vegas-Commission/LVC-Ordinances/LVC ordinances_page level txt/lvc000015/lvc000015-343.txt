SECTION 3. Section 4 of Ordinance No. 233, also known as Section 12, Chapter 7, Code of Las Vegas,
Nevada, 1949, is hereby amended to read as follows:

Signs shall be classified according to their relation to street or alley as parallel or angle.

Parallel signs are those whose face is parallel to the direction of travel and if not supported by being
attached to the building or not used to advertise a business being conducted on the same lot, must be at
least ten (10) feet from the property line adjacent to said street or alley. Where a parallel sign is
supported by or attached to a building it shall be allowed to project eight (8) inches beyond the side
or supporting edge of said building. Angle signs, except double-face or V-type signs, shall be treated
the same as parallel signs, so far as minimum distance is concerned. V-type signs shall be considered
double angle signs facing two directions connected or joined structurally, and must be at least ten (10)
feet from the property line adjacent to street or alley, for regular billboard signs, and at an increased
distance in proportion to added height. For signs up to twelve (12) feet length 4 x 4 supports spaced
not more than five (5) feet must be used; for signs longer than twelve (12) feet, 4 x 6 supports spaced
not more than eight (8) feet must be used; provided, metal supports of size approved by Building Inspector
may be used, and additional bracing on all signs must be approved. Single-face signs and the back of all
signs visible from street or alley must be painted in a sightly manner. All signs must have metal face
at least 28 g. thickness, or equivalent, and must have proper moulding and framing around sign in proportion
to size of sign. Ground space within ten (10) feet in all directions from the base of sign structure must
be kept free and clear of all weeds, rubbish and other inflammable waste or material. All signs supported
by a building and projected over the sidewalk shall provide clearance of not less than eight and one-half
(8½) feet from the bottom portion of said sign to the highest portion of the sidewalk below and shall not
extend further than twelve (12) inches inside the face of the curb. The Building Department is hereby
authorized to require a plan check of any sign in the event the head of the Building Department determines
such check necessary to determine the structural stability, and if such plan check is ordered the fee
therefor shall be paid by the applicant as provided in Section 1 hereinabove.

SECTION 4. In the event the applicant shall apply for construction of a sign using alternate
materials or types of construction not herein covered, the suitability thereof shall be determined by
the Board of Appeals established pursuant to the Uniform Building Code of the City of Las Vegas.

SECTION 5. This ordinance shall be in full force and effect upon its publication as in the next
section provided, and final passage.

SECTION 6. The City Clerk and Clerk of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas shall
cause this ordinance to be published once a week for two successive weeks immediately following its first
reading and adoption, in the Las Vegas Sun, a daily newspaper published in the City of Las Vegas.
