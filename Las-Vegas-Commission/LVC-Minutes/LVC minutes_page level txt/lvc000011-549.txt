Baumgardner, Baumgardner	for the reclassification of property located on the west side of 14th Street, one-half

and Hill	block north of Fremont Street, legally described as Lots 14, 15, and 16, Block 9, Ladd

Addition, from R-3 to R-4. This application was held in abeyance at the regular meeting 
Referred to Planning                 of the Board of City Commissioners held August 5, 1959.

Commission

Deputy Director of Planning, Donald Saylor, advised the Commission that there had been
no protests to this application at the public hearing held by the Planning Commission;
however, there was a petition from adjoining property owners indicating they were in
approval. He stated further that the Planning Commission had recommended denial on
the basis that this would be spot zoning and if these three lots were rezoned to R-4
it would result in a mixture of land uses. In order to get around this problem, it
was suggested this whole R-3 zone be considered for rezoning to R-4.

Mr. Baumgardner was present and stated his plans were to increase his units from 12
to 20 and that there was ample parking facilities and everything necessary to comply
with all the ordinances.

Commissioner Whipple moved this rezoning application be referred back to the Planning
Commission with the recommendation that serious consideration be given the rezoning
of the surrounding area to R-4.
