The Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas do ordain as follows:

Section 1. Every person, having physical ability to do so, when convicted of any offense in violation of
the ordinances or Code of the City of Las Vegas, and committed to jail therefor, may be required to work upon
the streets, public works, building and grounds of the City, not exceeding eight (8) hours each working day,
and the Chief of Police, or other person having such person in charge while performing such work, may employ any
reasonable humane and efficient means to prevent such prisoner from escaping from custody while being so em-
ployed .

Sect ion 2. For each and every day's work done by any person, he shall be allowed Two Dollars ($2.00) for
each day's work on account of such fines and costs.

Section 3. If any prisoner convicted under this Ordinance shall refuse to work, having physical ability
so to do when required to so work as in this Ordinance so provided, may, as a punishment, be compelled to "pack
sand" or carry other material from place to place, or to perform other labor not unreasonable, inhuman or too
burdensome, until he declares himself willing to work, and does work as required; or in lieu thereof, he may,
in the discretion of the Chief of Police, be confined in a cell and be fed upon no other food except bread and
water, until he declares himself ready to work; both methods of punishment for refusing to work shall in no
case be inflicted upon the same person at the same time. In either case of punishment for refusing to work as
required, such person shall receive no allowance or credit upon his term of work or imprisonment for such
forced labor or solitary confinement.
