on account of the shape or size of any lot or lots an assessment for a different number of feet would be more
equitable; and the frontage of all lots to be assessed shall be deemed to be the aggregate number of feet as
determined upon for the assessment by the assessor.

Section 4. After the special assessment roll, as herein provided for, shall cause notice thereof
to the persons whose names appear upon the assessment roll, and to all others interested therein, to be
published for at least two weeks in some newspaper published in the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, of the time when
the Board of Commissioners and the Ex-Officio City Assessor will meet to review the assessments, and any person,
objecting to the assessments, may file his objections thereto with the City Clerk.

Section 5. At the time appointed for reviewing the assessments, the Board of Commissioners and the
Ex-Officio City Assessor shall meet and give all persons interested and opportunity to be heard, and shall con-
sider any and al objections that may be filed with the City Clerk, and then, or at some adjourned meeting,
shall review the assessments and correct the same, and confirm it as corrected, or confirm it as reported, or
annul it, and direct a new assessment to be made.

Section 6. When the assessments shall be confirmed as herein provided, it shall be final and con-
clusive. The City Clerk shall thereupon deliver to the County Assessor, acting Ex-Officio City Assessor, the
Assessment Roll as confirmed by the Board of Commissioners, with his certificate of such confirmation, and of
the date thereof. The County Assessor, acting Ex-Officio City Assessor, shall thereupon, without extra com-
pensation, record such Assessment Roll in his office, and append thereto his certificate of the date of such
recording, whereupon from said date all persons shall be deemed to have notice of the contents of such Assess-
ment Roll, and it shall be prima facie evidence in all courts and tribunals of the regularity of all proceed-
ings preliminary to the making thereof, and of the validity of the assessment and Assessment Roll. After the
Assessment Roll has been confirmed and recorded, the several amounts levied thereon shall become at once due
and payable, and shall constitute and be a lien upon the respective lots and parcels of land, and improvements
assessed, and shall be charged against the persons and properties until paid, provided that upon approval of
any assessment, the amount thereof may be divided into not less than four nor more than ten installments, one
of such installments to be collected each year, at such time as the Board may determine, with an annual interest
at a rate not exceeding 7%.

Section 7. All assessments, when due and payable, as in this ordinance provided, shall be paid to
the tax receiver of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, and by that officer paid into and credited to the special
fund to be known as and called "Las Vegas Street Improvement Assessment District No. 100-2 Fund".

Section 8. All costs and expenses incurred in making the improvements shall be charged to and paid
out of said fund, provided, however, that all monies drawn on the General Fund of the City of Las Vegas to de-
fray any of the costs and expenses of making the improvements, or, if it shall become necessary to draw upon the
General Fund to defray any of the costs and expenses of the improvements, except as otherwise provided by the
Charter of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, the General Fund shall be reimbursed by transfer of funds from the
"Las Vegas Street Improvement Assessment District No. 100-2 Fund", as soon as conditions of the same will
permit.

Section 9. This ordinance shall be and become effective immediately after its adoption, approval and
the publication thereof for two consecutive weeks in the Las Vegas Review Journal, published in the City of
Las Vegas.

Section 10. The City Clerk of the City of Las Vegas is hereby authorized and directed to cause this
ordinance to be published in the Las Vegas Review Journal, a daily newspaper published in the City of Las Vegas
for a period of once a week for two consecutive weeks, immediately after its final passage and approval at this
meeting.
