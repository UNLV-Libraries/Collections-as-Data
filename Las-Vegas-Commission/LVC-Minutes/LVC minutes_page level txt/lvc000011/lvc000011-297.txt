(Note: Continued from

earlier in meeting)	Bud Swanson introduced Sr. Major Harold L. Nadeau, Officer in Charge of the Salvation Army,

	who explained that this shelter has been maintained at the old Welfare Administration Building

Salvation Army Shelter	behind the City Shops and that last year they received notice that they would have to vacate

this location just as soon as possible due to the fact that the proposed freeway would be
coming through there. The Major explained that they house some twenty to thirty a night and
serve between 800 to 1300 meals a week at the Shelter, and there is no question that it is
an asset to the City of Las Vegas as it would be a problem to the Police Department to care
for these people.
