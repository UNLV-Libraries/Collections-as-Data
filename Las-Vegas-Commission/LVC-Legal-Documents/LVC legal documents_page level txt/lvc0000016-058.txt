of these bonds; that we are to advise with you as to the type of bonds and time when they may be, in our
opinion, sold to advantage.

It is understood that we may associate with us such person or persons, including bond attorneys, as we may
believe particularly fitted to assist us in the carrying out of this agreement.

In consideration of our services you agree to pay us the sun of $800.00 for services rendered in connection
