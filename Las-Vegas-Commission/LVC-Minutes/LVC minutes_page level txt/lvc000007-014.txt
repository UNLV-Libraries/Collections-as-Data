His Honor asked if there were any persons present who wished to object to this assessment.

Mr. John Sulawske asked why there was a difference in the assessed values of the lots.

Mr. Oglesby explained there were only three lots in this district that had not
been raised in their assessed valuation by the Clark County Board of Equaliza-
tion, and the property owners of these lots had appeared at the meeting of the
Board of Equalization and objected to the raise. 

Mr. Emerson D. Williams said that he had not received notice of the meeting
of the Board of Equalization, and therefore had no chance to attend this
meeting.

Mr. Henry L. Chretien asked how deep the sewer will go. He stated that if it is
not at least feet deep he and others will not be able to connect. City Manager
George O. Treem, checked this and said that it will be deep enough.

Mr. James Smith and Mr. Joe Petty also complained that they had not received no-
tification of the meeting of the Board of Equalization.

His Honor told these people that there was nothing the Board of Commissioners
could do about the lots that had not been raised in assessed valuation. This
matter will have to be taken up with the Clark County Board of Equalization
when they meet next July.
