Mr. Kennedy stated the Pay Plan, as recommended allows for the meritorious 
increases for the fiscal year 1958-1959, based on length of service in position.

He explained there are 41 less people authorized in the Budget for 1958-59 on a
full time basis than were authorized in the Budget for the fiscal year of 1957-
1958. He stated that at the present time the City has less than the 533 employees
authorized, so adoption of this Plan will not mean that any person will be relieved
of his job with the City. He further explained that a check of the total cost of
the proposed Pay Plan with the Budget for 1958-59 shows that it can be financially
taken care of within the Budget.

Mr. Kennedy advised that there was one other think that he did not include in his
letter of recommendation - an explanation that the Pay Plan, as recommended, is a
full four year step program.

Commissioner Fountain asked the City Manager if he had talked to Mayor Baker by
telephone on this recommendation, and if the Mayor agreed with this change in
the Police and Fire Departments pay schedule.

Mr. Kennedy stated that he did discuss this matter with Mayor Baker on Tuesday,

July 1st, and advised him of his recommendation on the Pay Plan and asked the
Mayor if he had any objections or suggested changes, and he further advised the
Mayor he would like to request the Commission to approve this recommendation on
July 2nd. Mr. Kennedy stated that the Mayor had indicated he had no objection
to the recommendation, nor to the matter being placed on the agenda for the
regular meeting of July 2nd for Board action.

The City Manager reported on the Classification study, and stated that it is his
recommendation that it be adopted as presented and amended. He reported that the
Classification Plan provides a job description and classification for the different
types of employment within the City. He explained that it also changes the names
of the existing classifications so that they will coincide with the names used in
private industry and other public employment, thereby making it easier for the City
to secure information from the outside relative to pay and other benefits given an
employee doing a particular type of work. He continued that the Classification
Plan does away with 41 descriptions previously used by combining identical and
similar work under one classification, and as nearly as possible doing away with
descriptions for one person only.

Mr. Kennedy requested that the Pay Plan and Classification Plan as recommended, be
approved, and presented a proposed resolution for adoption.

Commissioner Fountain moved the Pay Plan and Classification Plan, as recommended
by the City Manager, be approved, and the following resolution as amended, be
adopted:
