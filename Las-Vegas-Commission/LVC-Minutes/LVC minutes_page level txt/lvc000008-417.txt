At this time Mayor Baker addressed the audience and made the following statement:

The Board of Commissioners is determined that in view of the
fact that there are considerable discrepancies in the assess-
ments levied, that there are some inconsistencies in the pro-
portion of payment, that there were some areas included that
should not have been included and there are other areas to be
included; and due to the fact that time has run out and it
will be impossible to continue the projects and get them on
the Assessment Roll for this year, it has been decided to de-
fer action on these projects until December and in the interim
make a review of the same. The property owners will be advised
when the projects are under advisement. Additional time will
be given for payment in cash. Thank you for coming. We are
trying to do the best for the most people.

The Mayor advised the people that all cash payments made on
these districts will be refunded.

Commissioner Whipple moved the application of Irving F. Quale and Wallace E. Gogert for transfer
of the license of the Square Deal Loan, 118 North 1st Street, formerly issued to Glen Tondevold,
be approved subject to investigation by the Police Department.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Jarrett and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners Bunker,

Jarrett, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent: Commissioner Peccole.
