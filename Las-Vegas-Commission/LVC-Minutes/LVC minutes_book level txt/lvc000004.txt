Minutes of a Special Meeting of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas
held on the 17th day of February 1937,

Roll call showed the following present Mayor Arnett, Commissioners Down, Krause, Marble
and Perry, City Attorney and Clerk, also City Engineer.

On motion of commissioner Marble seconded by Commissioner Perry it was moved and carried
that letters in the following forms be forwarded to The State Director of Public Works in Reno:

February 16, 1937.

State Director,

Public Works Administration,

Reno, Nevada.

Dear Sir;

Enclosed herewith please find three copies of a proposed resolution
to be adopted by the City relating to Engineering Costs proposed to be included in the costs
of Las Vegas Street Improvements, designated PWA Docket Nevada 1021-D.

The City Charter Sec. 5½, creating the office of City Engineer, states as follows:

"The Board of City Commissioners may create the office of City Engineer. the city engineer
shall be appointed by the board of city commissioners, and shall receive such compensation
as may be fixed by said board. The city engineer shall perform all the engineering and sur-
veying required by the city, in the carrying on of any public works and improvements, and
prepare all estimates, plans and specifications of any public improvements or sidewalks...

Said city engineer may be allowed such deputies, assistants or clerks, as in the judgment of
the Board of commissioners may be necessary; such deputies, assistants or clerks to be paid
such compensation as may be fixed by said Board of commissioners.... He shall report to the
board of commissioners from time to time and whenever required, and shall perform such other
and further duties as may be required by the board of commissioners of which may be prescribed
by ordinance."

As stated in the resolution, the practices has been to have engineering work involving
additional work and responsibilities performed on a regular percentage basis. This has been
the case in the 1929 and 1931 Street Improvement districts and in the sewer construction
projects from 1932 to 1934; work in relief sewer construction during 1934 and 1935 an addit-
ional salary was allowed the City Engineer for construction of a project on which plans had
previously been prepared. Percentage fees on improvement district projects have varied from
six to nine per cent, and salary increases during construction up to 80% more than the regular
 salary.
Application to the Federal government for this project's approval was made in August, 1935,
and from the date of application to the present time additional duties involving large amounts of
work, study and time have been assigned to the present city engineer without compensation in
addition to his regular salary on the contingent pasis that is the project be started, the usual
percentage fees should apply. This is further evidenced by the fact that from the inception of the
application, a percentage was set up by the City in conformity with its past actions in such
matters.

The City has advanced funds for assistants to the City engineer, and expects to continue to
do so, and for this reason and since payment for such services are ordinarily figured in the en-
gineering percentage, the estimated amount therefore has been deducted in establishing the amounts
of 2% as a reasonable additional compensation, above regular salary, for the city engineer, as
being the amount which the city would have to pay for similar work had an outside engineer been
employed.

The amount set up is believed to be reasonable, it less than amounts previously paid for
similar work, and no salary limit is placed by the charter other than that placed by the Board
which in this case has been guided by standard charges for similar work as a minimum. The City
engineer is not prohibited from doing wort outside of his regular duties and receiving compen-
sation therefor.

Should the City have engaged another engineer to carry on this project from the beginning
to end it would have been of great inconvenience and grater cost, and necessity demanded that
the City act on the basis which it has and which it deems justified.

Very Truly yours,

L.L. Arnett
Mayor.

RE: CITY OF LAS VEGAS NON-ELIGIBILITY FOR
GRANT OF APPLICANTS REGULAR EXPENSES

Dear Sir;

We have come to the conclusion that it is doubtful whether the City Attorney, being em-
ployed upon a regular salary, is entitled to compensation for services performed in connection
with this project.

This will, therefore, advise that no extra compensation for the City Attorney for regular
services performed in connection with this project will be requested.

Very respectfully

L.L. Arnett, Mayor.

Jesse H. Evans, Acting State Director PWA,

Reno, Nevada.

Dear Sir;

Attached please find a copy of a letter the City of Las Vegas has re-
ceived from the construction firm of Bebek and Brkich. Said firm has been awarded the con-
tract for the Las Vegas Street improvement Project known as Docket	No. 1021-D.

The Board of Commissioners	will grant thie request, paying of	labor by check,	if	the

same	meets with the approval of	the Director of PWA for Nevada.

Will	you kindly advise me as to	your decision at an early date as the construction	on	this

project was started the 15th day of February, 1937.

Thanking you for your co-operation in this matter, I am,

Truly yours,

City of Las Vegas, City Hall,

Las Vegas, Nevada.

Attention C.D.Baker, City Engineer,

Dear Sir;

We hereby request permission to pay workers by check on the Las Vegas
Street Improvement Project, Docket No. 1021D. We feel that we are justified in this
request for the following reasons—
1.	Shortage in payment is eliminated that might occur when counting large sums of money in many
small parcels and in odd amounts.

2. It is dangerous to keep a large sum of money available in the temporary quarters that circum-
stances require the contractor to keep, and where no vault is available for safe keeping.

3.	Should it become necessary to dismiss a worker, it would be very awkward and inconvenient to
have cash on the job site to cover such contingencies.

4.	The contractor has established a checking account in the First State Bank of Las Vegas, Nevada.

Ample funds will be kept there at all times to cover payrolls.

Respectfully submitted
Bebek and Brkich

By T.G. Hawley.

Vote was Commissioners Down, Krause, Marble and Perry and His Honor the Mayor voting aye.

INDIVIDUAL PROJECT REPORT

Las Vegas, Nevada.

Attention: DIVISION OF INFORMATION SERVICE

Report covering Official Project Number 165-4-5002, NW of City of

Work Project Number 286, Located at Las Vegas

Date Project Started Oct 23 1935, Date Completed Not.

Average Number Persons Employed 48 for March
Name of Sponsor City of Las Vegas.

Statement giving in detail the Physical Accomplishments of the Project
and the Economic and Social Value of the Project to the Community.

During the month of March, 1937, No. 1 Pond was partially drained and one truck load
of young fish was transplanted to Boulder Lake.

We completed the pouring of 1250 ft. of footing and about 700 ft of wall on No. 3

Pond.

Through the cooperation of the City, furnishing trucks, we graveled about one and
one-half miles of roadway on this project.

The foundation was poured for the caretaker's house and work will continue on this
building until it is completed.

We also hope to complete the wall on the No. 3 Pond during the month of April but at
present are handicapped due to practically all of our WPA workers being on outside
employment.

Some excavation was carried on in No. 3 Pond, the dirt being used for the ramp and
fill on the south wing, which is practically completed.

We planted the cuttings of 1600 weeping willow trees	on ponds	No. 1	and 2 and part

of	the area on No. 3. These were of	course planted thicker	than necessary, as it was 

expected in that number of transplantings we would have quite a loss, but hope to get a
good start on these threes this coming summer.

From all indications there should be a large crop of young fish this coming summer
for transplanting to Boulder Lake.

This project is now in such shape that we can work either a large or small crew
according to the WPA labor available.

The value of this project will	begin to show when the	fish are	being	transplanted

to	Boulder Lake became large enough	for fisherman to start	catching	them.	At the present

time there is no other source of supply for game fish in Boulder Lake.

In addition, as the plant growth and shrubbery gets older it will make a valuable
park area for the City of Las V gas.

specify that such question shall be voted on at the next general city election and such question shall, in the
form above provided, be placed upon the general ballot at such general city election. Said bonds shall be sold
at not less than their par value and shall be redeemable in the order of their issuance within twenty-five years
from the date of issue. The said board shall provide for the payment of said bonds and the interest thereon at
the time of regular tax levy for state and county and city purposes by levying an additional tax upon the prop-
erty, real and personal, within the limits of the city, sufficient in their judgment to pay the interest upon
said bonds semi-annually as it becomes due, and the principal at such rate as will redeem all of the bonds
within twenty-five years from the date of their issue; in which case the twenty-five years shall begin to run
from the date of the particular bond to be paid. The said taxes shall be assessed and collected the same as
other taxes paid to the county treasurer and by him placed in a fund to be known as the "Las Vegas Sewerage
Fund." All sewerage systems constructed under the provisions of this act shall be constructed under the super-

Building and Trades Council in regards to the issuing of an Electrical contractors
license to one a Mr. R. E. Swigart to operate within the City of Las Vegas and to
do electrical work therein. Mr. Swigart claimed to have previously taken the re-
quired electrical masters examination to work and operate in the City of Las Vegas

as an electrical contractor within said City of Las Vegas -

sent of all present that a later meeting should be called where upon a full rep-
resentation of all the City Board members would be present and a full expression from

Minutes of a recessed regular meeting of the Board of Commissioners of the City
of Las Vegas, Nevada held on the 16th, day of August 1937 at the hour of three o'clock P.M.

Present: Mayor L. L. Arnett, Commissioners Herbert Krause, H. P. Marble and Joe S.
Ronnow. City Attorney Harry H. Austin and Deputy City Clerk Le Roy Whipple.

Absent; - Commissioner H. L. Perry and City Clerk Viola Burns -

At this time Mr. Ralph Swigart again appeared before the board to renew his re-
quest to operate as an electrical contractor within the City without first taking the
prescribed masters electrical examination. He was supported in his request by attorney
Geo. E. Marshall who stated before the Board that as far as he was able to interpret
the City Ordinance covering this case, he could see no reason why Mr. Swigart should not
 be given a license to operate as a master electrician without taking the examination as
he had taken such examination in 1931 and was therefore in good standing.

The Local Electrical Contractors present were represented by Attorney Roger Foley
who quoted from the City Ordinance No. 161 and as amended by Ordinance No. 174 that in -
as much as Mr. Swigart had left the City and had failed to keep up his license and re-
gular dues that the ordinance now requested him to retake such prescribed examination
and be able to pass such before he should be permitted to operate as an electrical con-
tractor within the City of Las Vegas. Arguments developed from both sides both for and
against the situation inquestion. Mayor Arnett said that he thought the question should
be left with the City Attorney to answer, as it involved a point of law in conjunction
with the City Ordinance which was really in question, and that he was willing to abide by
such interpretation. There upon Commissioner Marble asked in writing of the City Attorney
the following question " Can the Board of City Commissioners Legally at this time grant
a license as Master Electrician to Ralph Swigart, who in 1931 took the prescribed examination
and operated thereunder until 1933 at which time he allowed his license to lapse, and now
applies for a license to be granted without examination. ". H.P. M. In answer to this
question " Legally, I say No," Mr. Austin Answered in Writing. Commissioner Marble then
introduced a motion to, accept the City Attorney's ruling and was seconded by Commissioner
Ronnow. Vote being; Com' Krause, Marble, & Ronnow and His Honor the Mayor Voting Aye Noes
none, Absent Commissioner , Perry. The Mayor then announced that the decision would
stand.

Sealed bids were then opened covering prices on form ' Purchase Order Blanks' Bids

of acceptance to be stated on bid accepted, motion was seconded by Commissioner Ronnow and
the following vote taken, Commissioner, Krause, Marble and Ronnow and His Honor the Mayor

notation that it was the low bid made. The bid being $10.32 per M. for 5M order. All bids
were then turned over to Mr. C. D. Baker, Purchasing Agent for his approval and checking

5 M copies @ $10.32 per M. or a total of $51.60 and was seconded by Commissioner Ronnow,

At this time A. W. Blackman asked of the Board what disposition should be made of
the funds regularly collected at the Municipal Plunge, and was advised that all funds
collected should be deposited with the City Clerk, for deposit to the general city funds.
Commissioner Ronnow suggested that the board investigate the statement Mr. Lorenzie made
at a previous meeting regarding the cut in prices made by the Municipal Plunge under the
going prices the private swimming pools had established and all agreed to look into the
matter.

Commissioner Marble then asked the board if it was their understanding that the salary
of the City Engineer should be raised to $300.00 per. month, that he understood from pre-
vious discussions that it would be. Mayor Arnett then stated that there had been no agree-
ment to raise his salary at the present time, and that the City Engineer would be allowed
to continue his private practise under the same salary now paid until the first of the
year at which time the new budget is adopted. That under the present economy programme
which the commission has been forced it would be impossible to make the increase in
salary. The Mayor also stressed the fact that cuts in expenditures had been made on every
hand even to the extent that some departments had been forced to reduce the number of employees
 they had. The salaries of the City Treasurer and City Assessor were discussed and
on motion of Commissioner Ronnow seconded by Commissioner Krause it was moved that they
both be reduced $25.00 per month. Vote being Commissioners Krause, Marble and Ronnow and

REPORT POWER BOARD

April 4, 1938

To the Honorable City Commissioners
City of Las Vegas,

Las Vegas, Nevada.

Gentlemen:

On March 8th your Honorable Body turned over to the newly organized Power Board
the question of construction or acquisition of a Municipal Power System for the City of Las
Vegas, requesting a decision or recommendation within a few days in order to meet the require-
ments of the Public Works Administration which had previously approved the project for loan
and grant.

Several meetings have been had during which the proposal has been thoroughly discussed. It is
the opinion of the undersigned members of the Board that the time allotted is insufficient
to permit a thorough investigation, and that the data now at hand is not adequate for final
recommendation.

We feel, also, that this Board, given proper support, and sufficient time can render an import-
ant service, but do not feel it should be called upon to decide in such a short time a quest-
ion that has been before your Honorable Body for several months.

There has been some consideration given to rate schedules now in effect in Las Vegas. This
subject should also have exhaustive study, before the City can establish a Municipal Power
System and we are of the opinion that relief should be secured now where it is apparent
schedules are too high.

If it is the desire of your Honorable Board that we proceed further with a view to making a
full and complete determination of this matter, we beg leave to request that you authorize
the retention of a consulting engineer, satisfactory both with the City Commission and the
Power Board., in order that we may be intelligently advised in the task of gathering the
necessary data.

It is the opinion of this Board that we have gone as far as we can without this being done.

Respectfully submitted,

The Las Vegas Power Board

W.E. Ferron	Bryan L. Bunker

W.H. Pike	John Miller.

missioners Krause, Ronnow and Mayor Pro Tem Marble voting aye. Noes, none.

Las Vegas, Nevada,

April 18th, 1938.

To the Chairman and Members of the

Las Vegas Electric Light and Power Board,

Las Vegas, Nevada.

Gentlemen;

This will acknowledge receipt of your preliminary report on the proposed Munici-
pal Power System for the city of Las Vegas, wherein a definite recommendation is withheld until
additional engineering report be procured.

In this connection you are advised that to secure such additional report would cost a very
considerable sum-estimated at from fifteen hundred ($1,500.00) Dollars to two thousand ($2,000.00)
Dollars-for which, funds are at present unavailable; all of which would probably necessitate a
short time loan, if such could be arranged.

Will you please give the Board of City Commissioners at an early date, your recommendation
as to whether or not such loan should be arranged, bearing in mind that in the event the project
failed to go through, either by purchase or construction, the entire cost of such emergency
loan must be borne by the municipality an expenditure which we hesitate to place on the tax-
payers in the absence of the definite endorsement of our Board.

An Immediate response on this phase of the matter, together with any other recommendations
you desire to submit, will be appreciated.

Very respectfully,

H.P. Marble,

Mayor Pro Tem
Joe S. Ronnow,

City Commissioner
Herbert Krause,

ution.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

301 Continental Bank Building
Salt Lake City. Utah.

May 31, 1938

Mr. H.P. Marble,

Mayor,

Las Vegas, Nevada.

Dear Sir;

When former Special Agent in Charge Val C. Zimmer of this office conferred with you
earlier this month, he advised that he would secure certain information from this Bureau at
Washington concerning the number of fingerprints submitted by the Las Vegas Police Department
over the past six or seven years.

I am listing hereinafter the criminal fingerprints received and retained from the Police
Department of your city during the designated periods:-

Fiscal Year	Number

1930	29

1931	615

1932	145

1933	39

1934	80

1935	25

1936	400

1937	1,397

1938	(July 1, 1937 through

April 30, 1938)	1.752

Total	4,482

You will note that the above years are fiscal rather than calendar years, and that during
the past two years the number of criminal fingerprints received by the Bureau from your Police
Department have increased tremendously.

I presume you are also acquainted with the fact that your Chief of Police David Mackey, has
submitted numerous civil fingerprints to this Bureau also.

Trusting this information well be of some interest to you, I am,

Very Truly Yours
Jay C. Newman
Special Agent in Charge.

in protest to the coming of a carnival in that district on north 5th, street. Reason for
such protest was that such a business was not desirable to residences in that district.

The Board explained to the committee present that so long as the carnival payed the necessary
license fee of $100.00 per day, and met all requirements, of the city ordinances that nothing
could be done to move them unless the city ordinances were not lived up to by such carnival
It was suggested that the committee appear before the Veterans of Foreign Wars and make some
arrangements with them to locate the carnival in another spot as that organization was probably
the ones that secured the present location from the owner of the property for the carnival.

No further business appearing before the Board at this time--------------------------

Las Vegas, Nevada
October 9, 1939

Honorable John Russell, Mayor,

City Counsel.

Dear Sirs:

The Junior Chamber of Commerce in an effort to beautify the City of Las Vegas has appoint-
ed a committee to act upon the City Beautification.

This Committee has as a result of it's observation, found that the corner of Pth and Fremont
Streets, upon which is operated Mr. Stock's Planing Mill, is very unsightly and that it is viewed
by all tourists upon entering and leaving the City of Las Vegas. The Committee has called upon Mr.
Stocks and found him very congenial and very willing to co-operate and has has stated that later
he will attempt to clean this lot up. However, it has been the experience of the committee,
especially in the case of Mr. Bill Mendelsohn, that although promises were made that the promises
were not carried out.

It has also been called to the attention of the committee that Mr. Stocks is soon to make
application for a building permit so that he may build a new are house and planing mill on this pro-
perty. This will of course, assure us that this type of business will be carried on on one of the
front streets of our city for many years. It seems quite reasonable that if debris and scrap
lumber are found in connection with the planing mill now located on this property that this will be
true in the years to come.
It seems that it would be a simple matter for the City Commission to insist upon a written
letter from Mr. Stocks stating that he will keep all unsightly objects from the view of passers-by
upon Fremont Street. This would serve to make him realize his obligation to keep his property free
from suck unsightly properties and also assure the city commission and those parties interested
that this would be done.

We are not, as young members of this community, attempting to in any way interfere with the
individual property rights or with the government as it is being carried on, but, as interested
citizens in the future of our town and community, we are merely attempting by suggestion to help
in its development. I am enclosing a letter as a way of suggestion, that night be used as a model
for Mr. Stocks to sign.

Sincerely yours,

Jas. H Down, Jr.

President, Junior Chamber of Commerce
Bert O'Donnell Beautification Committee.

Thereupon on motion of Commissioner Gilbert seconded by Commissioner Corradetti it was moved
that the application of Mr. Stocks for a building permit for the erection of a warehouse at 8th
and Fremont Street should be held up until such time as a suitable settlement had been made.

Vote Commissioners Ronnow, Gilbert, Krause and Corradetti and His Honor the Mayor voting aye.
Noes, none.

rules given him, in writing from the District Attorney Roland Wiley:

Las Vegas, Nevada,

November 2nd, 1939.

Honl John Russell, Mayor
City of Las Vegas

Harold Morse,

Attorney at Law
Las Vegas, Nevada.

Gentlemen;

Pursuant to your question concerning whether or not the game commonly known as "80 Ball
Keno" and also the game designated as "Race Horse Parly" constitute a lottery under the Constitution
and laws of the state of Nevada, I wish to cite you to a decision rendered on the 19th day of March
1932, by the Hon. Wm. E. Orr, now Justice of the Supreme Court of the State of Nevada, and then
Judge of the Eighth Judicial District Court in and for the County of Clark.

The Minute order of this decision, a copy of which is annexed hereto, may be found in Look II, page
126, of the minutes of the Eighth Judicial District Court, in and for the County of Clark. In this
case, Judge Orr sustained a Demurrer to the petition for Writ of Mandamus, upon the ground "the
game was described in the petition is a lottery and not authorized by the constitution and laws of
the State of Nevada."

It will be noted the game described in the petition as "80Ball Keno" is substantially the same as
the game in the application designated and called "Race Horse Parley". In "80 Ball Keno" the game
is played with cards having 80 numbers, whereas in "Race Horse Parley" the game is played identi-
cally the same, excepting the names of 80 horses are substituted for numbers.

After reviewing a number of authorities cited in the able briefs of counsel in that case, and bear-
ing mind the decision of the Court, I am of the opinion that "80 Bell Keno" and Race Horse Parley"
are lotteries and prohibited by Section 75, Article 4, of the Constitution of the State of Nevada,
which reads as follows:

"No lottery shall be authorized by this State, nor shall the sale of lottery tickets be allowed"
and as defined in Section 10176 of the Nevada Complied Laws of 1929, which reads as follows:

"A lottery is any scheme for the disposal of distribution of property, by chance, among
persons who have paid or promised to pay any valuable consideration for the chance of
obtaining such property, or a portion of it, or for any share or any interest in such
property, upon any agreement, understanding, or expectation what it is to be distributed
or disposed of by lot or chance, whether called a lottery, raffle or gift enterprise,
or by whatever name the same may be known."

In view of this fact, it would be my duty, and I would not hesitate, to issue a criminal Complaint
against anyone operating in Clark County the games heretofore described, or any other game pro-
hibited by the Constitution and laws of the State.

I wish to point out that in giving this opinion, I am in no way influenced by matters of policy

I have been requested for an opinion by each of you gentlemen and I feel it my duty to do so at
the earliest date possible.

Sincerely Yours,

Roland H. Wiley.

OFFICE OF THE CITY CLERK CITY OF
LAS VEGAS CLARK COUNTY, NEVADA.

APRIL 4th, 1940

Minutes of a regular meeting of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas Clark
County, Nevada held on the 4th day of April 1940 at the hour of seven thirty P.M.

Present Mayor Russell, Commissioners Gilbert, Krause and Corradetti, City Attorney and
City Clerk.

Absent Commissioner Ronnow.

Minutes of recessed regular meeting of March 29th read. Commissioner Gilbert ask that the
statement of Mayor Russell make to the Board at that time be incorporated in the minutes. Mayor
Russell handed the Clerk his witten statement as made to the Board at the meeting of March 29th
so that minutes of said meeting be corrected to read as follows:

In preparing a budget for the City of Las Vegas for the year 1940, we must have a true
statement of the actual Dec 31, 1938 bank balance, which is $49,733.89 as shown by the Annual
Financial Report of the City of Las Vegas dated Dec 31 1938. We must then take the amount of
money collected by the City in 1939 which is $192,829.00 and add $49,733.89 ( the 1939 bank bal-
ance) which would give us $241,162.89. All the money handled by the City in 1939.

The City spent $179,736.00 in 1939. To get our bank balance for Dec 31, 1939 you would have
to deduct $179,736.00 (the money spent by the City in 1939) from $241,162.89 (which is the 1938
bank balance and the money collected in 1939) this would give you $62,826.89. The correct
bank balance to start the 1940 budgeon , as I see it.

The proposed budget for 1940, (prepared by Mr. Ronnow, who was at that time Finance Commis-
sioner and Mr. Blackman the City Auditor) does not make sense. In the first place our bank bal-
ance as of Dec 31, 1939, taken from the fund statement was $62,826.69.

The bank balance used by Mr Ronnow and Mr. Blackman is preparing the 1940 budget for Las
Vegas was $53,785.83 a discrepancy of $9,040.70. A financial report on file in the City Clerk's
Office, shows the City balance as of December 31 1939 to be $51,092.61 a discrepancy of $11,754.08
A fund statement prepared by Mr. Blackman as of Dec 31,1939 is as follows:

Bank Balance Nov 30-39	$47,575.67

Taxes 4th installment	31,162.06

Dec Receipts	 9,032.25

Making a total Bank account of	87,769.98

Dec Expenditure (which includes the

$11,754.08 item) was	____24.943.29

Bank balance as of Dec 31 1939	62,826.69

Now if the sum of $11,754.08 is again taken out of the bank balance of $62,826.69 as of Dec
31,1939 we would have $51,092.61 as shown by the financial statement on file in the City Clerk's
office.

This item of $11,754.08 has been taken out of the bank balance at least twice since Nov.

80-39 as I figure it.

I do not believe in padding our budget.

If I can read this is what has been done.

At this time I	am	going to insist that an audit be made of the City books so	that we will

not be in the dark.	If	not, I think a grand jury investigation would be in order.	As long as	I

am mayor of this City I am going to insist that all our City business be conducted out in the open.
We will make mistakes, and many of they but I hope they will be honest mistakes.

The business of adopting a Resolution empowering the City of Las Vegas to make an emer-
gency loan in the sum of $20,000.00 was next considered and on motion of Commissioner Gilbert
seconded by Commissioner Corradetti the following Preambles and Resolution were duly adopted:
WHEREAS the City	of Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada, did on the 12th day of	September

A.D. 1935, enter in	to	a lease with Las Vegas Post Number 8, the American Legion,	Department

of the County Recorder of Clark County, Nevada, in Book 12 of Miscellaneous, at pages 8 and 9
thereof, and by the terms	of which	said lease the said	City did lease and let unto	said Post

The following letter was read to the Board at this time:

Las Vegas, Nevada,

August 5th, 1940.

To the Honorable Mayor and Members of the
Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas,

Las Vegas, Nevada.

Gentlemen;

Frequently requests are made to the Board of City Commissioners for certain ex-
penditures to be made for some specific improvement or work, and the person or persons making
the request are told that there is no money for such purpose in the City Budget.

Recently too, it has come to the attention of the Finance Commissioner of this Board,
that certain opposition has lately developed to the City's application for an emergency loan
on the ground that such loan is not necessary.

The budget law of the State requires that all expenditures for the year be included in,
and set up in that budget, under certain detail which the state legislature has required. There-
fore it is impossible for the City to make any expenditure in any given department unless such
item is included in the City budget for that department. Nor is it possible to use money
budgeted for one department for improvements in some other department.

In order to clear up these points in the public mind and to show not only the de-
sirability of making an emergency loan, but also the imperative necessity therefor, the
following statement and report has been prepared under my direction and at my request and the
which I herewith submit to you.

Respectfully,

A Corradetti,

Finance Commissioner.

City Attorney Austin then at the request of Commissioner Corradetti read the above-
mentioned report.

On motion of Commissioner Corradetti seconded by Commissioner Gilbert it was moved and
carried that the said report be spread on the minutes and that the Clerk forward a certified
copy of the report to the State Board of Finance.

REPORT OF FINANCE COMMISSIONER
AUGUST 5th, 1940.

Prior to January 16th, 1940, the local Post of the American Legion represented to certain
members of the Board of City Commissioners of this City that it was imperative that said Post
raise the sum of $10,000.00 to be used in retiring bonds against the War Memorial Building and
suggested selling the building to the City of Las Vegas for the sum of $15,000.00.

At a meeting of the Board of City Commissioners held on January 16th, 1940, the Mayor
appointed a committee consisting of Commissioners Joe S. Ronnow, C. V. T. Gilbert and Al Corra-
detti, to meet with the local Post of the American Legion relative to taking over the War Memo-
rial Building.

On February 9th, 1940, Commissioner Joe S. Ronnow reported for the committee to the City
Board the findings of said committee, favoring the said purchase for the sum of $15,000.00 and
requested a resolution of the City Board to set aside the sum of $10,000.00 from City funds, to
be placed in escrow upon such purchase.

On February 16th, 1940, this Board, all members being present, passed a resolution offering
tp purchase said War Memorial Building and certain furniture, equipment and contents for the
sum of $15,000.00, and authorizing the Mayor and City Clerk to draw a warrant on the City in the
sum of $10,000.00 upon the acceptance of the City's offer by said American Legion Post, and
directing that a copy of such resolution and offer be delivered to said American Legion Post
for action by such Post. The vote upon this resolution was as follows: Commissioner Ronnow,
Gilbert, Krause and Corradetti and His Honor, the Mayor, voting aye; voting no, none.

On February 21st, 1940 the resolution of the American Legion Post accepting the City's
offer was presented to this Board and this Board passed a resolution approving the contract of
purchase. The vote upon this resolution was as follows: Commissioner Ronnow, Krause and
Corradetti His Honor, the Mayor, voting aye; Voting No, none. Absent Commissioner Gilbert.

On March 4th, 1940, the Mayor discharged said committee of Ronnow, Gilbert and Corradetti
and thanked them for their co-operation and work in regard to the City taking over and making
the purchase of said War Memorial Building.

On March 8th, 1940, a resolution was adopted by this Board to borrow $20,000.00 from the
First National Bank of Nevada, Las Vegas Branch, $10,000.00 of which is to replace the $10,000.00
placed in escrow; $5,000.00 to complete the purchase price and which is due and payable on or before
December 31st, 1940, and $5,000.00 for remodelling the front of said Was Memorial Building for
City offices, and directing that notice thereof be published, as required by law. The vote
upon this resolution was as follows: Voting aye, Commissioner Ronnow, Gilbert, Krause, and
Corradetti, and His Honor, the Mayor; Voting No, none.

On April 4th, 1940, after legal publication of such notice, an emergency loan resolution was
adopted by this board, to borrow said sum of $20,000.00 from said bank for two and one half years
with interest at not to exceed five per centum per annum, and authorizing the Mayor and City
Clerk to sign the note or notes of the City therefor. The vote on said resolution was as
follows: Voting aye, Commissioner Gilbert, Krause and Corradetti and His Honor, the Mayor.

Voting No, none. Absent Commissioner, Ronnow.

On June 17th, 1940, on motion of Commissioner Gilbert, seconded by Commissioner Krause
it was moved and carried that the City Attorney be instructed to draft a letter to Governor
Carville and ascertain the State Board of	Finance would be	in session and requesting	the

Governor to call a special meeting of the	Board in the event a meeting	was not to be	held

for some time. The vote upon this motion	was as follows:	Voting aye,	Commissioner	Ronnow,

Gilbert, Krause and Corradetti, and His Honor, the Mayor.	Voting No,	none.

At this same meeting, on motion of Commissioner Gilbert, seconded by Commissioner Corra-
detti, it was moved and carried that Commissioner Ronnow attend the meeting of the State Board
of Finance in regard to the application of the City for permission to float said Emergency
Loan. The vote on this motion was as follows: Voting Aye, Commissioner Gilbert, Krause and
Corradetti and His Honor, the Mayor. Voting No, Commissioner Ronnow.

And at the same meeting it was moved by Commissioner Gilbert and seconded by Commissioner
Krause, that Finance Commissioner, Corradetti, accompany Commissioner Ronnow on said trip to
Carson City, The motion was carried by the following vote: Voting Aye, Commissioners Gilbert,
Krause, and His Honor, the Mayor. Voting No, Commissioners Ronnow and Corradetti.

Upon receipt of a letter from the Governor in answer to the letter written by the City
Attorney, naming July 1st, 1940, at 2-o'clock P.M. as the time for meeting, Commissioners Ro-
nnow and Corradetti and Auditor A. W. Blackman met with the Governor and Dan Franks in the
Governor's Chambers in the Capitol and discussed at length the need for such ah Emergency Loan.
Owing to the fact that Mr. Henry Schmidt, a member of the State Board of Finance, had been
called away on account of the death of a relative, there was not quorum present and official
action could not then be taken. The two members present expressed their opinion that the Board
would grant permission to make an Emergency Loan as requested, provided they receive a letter
from the County Commissioners of Clark County, stating that the County Commissioners had
approved a rate of $1.05 for the City of Las Vegas, which rate did include provision for the re-
payment of said Emergency Loan.

On July 5th, 1940, Commissioner Corradetti and Auditor, A. E. Blackeman, presented to the
County Commissioners the request of the State Board of Finance for the above mentioned letter,
and the County Commissioners caused a letter to be drawn setting forth the requested facts, and
mailed the same to the State Board of Finance. No word being received by the City from the
State Board of Finance, Commissioners Ronnow and Corradetti instructed the City Clerk to wire
an inquiry to the State Board of Finance, on July 27th, 1940. On the same day a reply stated
that the State Board of Finance would take action Monday afternoon July 29th, 1940. Not having
heard from them on July 31st, 1940, the City Clerk again wired a request as to what action had
been taken. In reply the State Board of Finance wired that they had written a letter reques-
ting the information mentioned above from the Board of County Commissioners. Evidently they
failed to receive the letter mailed July 5th, 1940, by the Board of County Commissioners.
Commissioner Ronnow immediately notified County Clerk, Lloyd S. Payne, and he telephoned Dan
Franks immediately and read him over the telephone a copy of the County Commissioners' letter.

The contents of this letter Mr. Franks relayed to the State Board of Finance at their meeting
on Thursday, August 1st, 1940. The next information regarding the matter was receipt by the
City Clerk of a copy of a letter from the State Board of Finance addressed to Hon. L. Russell
Mayor, stating that in accordance with his request for hearing, a meeting would be held at
2-o-clock P.M. on Thursday, August 8th, 1940 in the Governor's office for the purpose of hearing
such arguments as he, the Mayor, wished to present, said letter being signed for the State
Board of Finance, by D. G. La Rue, Secretary. Whatever communication the Mayor had sent to the
State Board of Finance was sent without the knowledge of any City Commissioner or any other
City official. Heretofore the Mayor has always emphatically demanded that all City business
be transacted in open meetings. He now, after having approved all steps leading up to the
application for said Emergency Loan, and having concurred in and voted for the appointment of a
committee whose sole duty it was to present arguments to the State Board of Finance that an
emergency for the making of said loan did and does exist, and after the City had received prac-
tical assurance that such application would be approved on August 1st, 1940, without consulting
any City Commissioner in open meeting or otherwise, requests the State Board of Finance to de-
lay the approval of said loan until he himself can appear personally before said Board.

The law requires the adoption of a City budget on or before Monday in March of each year
The budget adopted for the year of 1940 included the Emergency Loan in its item of revenue.

The various City departments have proceeded in their expenditures on the supposition that the
Emergency Loan would be granted. It would be unwise to proceed any longer with any uncertainty
existing that this revenue would not be available. Consequently all departments to the City
are hampered in their work by further delay.

The need for this Emergency Loan will appear from the following figures.

Budget estimates of non-tax revenue ( without taking the $15,000.00 Emergency Loan into
consideration ) are within $3,000.00 of the actual 1939 non-tax revenue. Certainly this
is a good, conservative estimate. ( refer to schedule A)

The revenue received to July 31, 1940, is very nearly three-quarters of the entire
year's revenue because the greatest part of the third quarter licenses are included. It
is easy to see that, while the amounts are approximately equal to three-fourths (3/4) of
the 1940 estimates, that they will not suffice to replace the Emergency Loan even under
the most favorable conditions.

The items shown below the line " Total Usable Non-Tax " are of no value in replacing
any loss in the items above because they are definitely restricted by statute to certain
special uses and are not available for operating expenses.

The conclusion from an examination of Schedule A is that the Emergency Loan will be
necessary to balance the 1940 budget.

- EXPENDITURES -

In Schedule B the items of expenditures are given in related group totals. This is
done to avoid confusing the reader with detail. Forty six (46) accounts having up to
twenty-two (22) segregations each, are here consolidated into fifteen (15) totals. The
detail is available to anyone interested, in the City books open to inspection, at all
reasonable times.

PROTECTION OF PERSONS AND PROPERTY (POLICE AND FIRE).

This budget item is estimated approximately $8,000.00 more than 1939 due to $4,000.00
salary expense increase in the police department to put the officers on an eight hour day
instead of twelve hours as formerly; $1,000.00 for additional fire hydrants in the Fire
Department; and $3,000.00 budgeted here for Plumbing and Building inspection formerly
budgeted elsewhere. The service in the Inspector's department was increased in 1940 also.

HEALTH AND SANITATION.

The increase in this budget item was $1,500.00 for repair to sewer and disposal
plant.

STREET LIGHTING.

During 1939 no money was available for the repair and extension of street lights.

An additional $3,000.00 was added here in 1940. Three times this amount is needed for pro-
per development.

MEMORIAL BUILDING.

The 1940 Budget calls for an expenditure of $15,000.00 to purchase the War Memorial
Building from the American Legion; and for $5,000.00 in remodeling the building to make
it suitable for City offices, now badly needed.

PARKS AND RECREATION.

The increase of $2,000.00 here is due to budgeting $1,050.00 to develop a park and
playground center on the Westside and $1,350.00 increased maintenance cost on the parks.

Those items below "Cemetery" on Schedule B are matters prepared for in the tax rate
in accordance with statute and are fixed and inflexible.

GENERAL COMMENTS.

The figures set forth in Schedule A and B indicate that the uncertainty of securing per-
mission to make the Emergency Loan has caused every department of the City to hold back and
do nothing but the urgent necessary work thus far in the year. With less than half of the
year before us, there remains much to be done if the year's quota of accomplishments is to
be reached. Streets are in need of repair; lighting is not adequate; the City Clerk's
office is postponing needed repairs from day to day in anticipation of a move; there remains
$5,000.00 to pay to the American Legion Post; summer is nearly gone and the Westside park
has not been touched; the milk inspection is handicapped for much needed equipment. All these
things are held in abeyance pending decision of the State Board of Finance on the request
for permission to make the Emergency Loan.

No salary increases were allowed in making the 1940 budget despite that some increases
are not only justified byt are long overdue by reason of the length of service, qualifications
of the incumbents and the work and responsibility carried. While these persons have been
patient and understanding so far, the City is in danger of losing very valuable employees on
account of inability to pay adequate salaries. This will surely hurt the City in general.

The average citizen does not know that the Budget Law of the State restricts the sec-
tion of the City Commissioners very closely. The Commission makes an annual budget on or
before the first Monday in March, and, when adopted, this budget governs the entire year's
expenditures very closely, With the exception of unforeseen emergencies, the Commission has
no power to make expenditures not prepared in the budget. Money can not be expended for
projects not due to unforeseeable emergencies simply because some unexpected revenue is derived.

The departments are so closely controlled on this point that the Auditor is instructed
to refuse any requisition from any department that would overdraw one twelfth (1/12) of that
department's annual budget for running expenses in any one month.

The purchasing and accounting system of the City is so devised and governed by ordinance
and rule that no bill for either material or services can be incurred by the City without ade-
quate authorization by the Commission before it is incurred. This given the Commission ab-
solute control of the expenditures. This control is the means whereby the City has been able to
meet the needs of a rapidly growing community so well in spite of limits and restricted revenue,
without becoming involved in any financial distress. The strictest economy has been necessary
to do this; the absolute control has made possible the enforcement of strict economy.

But economy is not the only problem in the financial management of the City affairs. The
method of collecting taxes (namely, quarterly installments beginning in December each year) causes
the tax revenue to lag behind the expenditures almost twelve months. The law provides that
certain items such as bond interest and redemption, must be paid by tax levies. This, together
with the necessity of redeeming large blocks of bonds and interest coupons at stated times, has
made a problem of having adequate cash balances in the right funds at stated times. This makes
necessary long range calculation to meet these needs; calculations difficult for the average
citizen to understand. Careful study is necessary to meet this problem and careful and con-
tinuous supervision in necessary to make the plans work. A cursory examination will not suffice
to decide what to do.

Each month, at regular meeting, each Commissioner has statements laid before him that show
the financial matters right up to date, and they each watch these matters very closely.

The law provides certain restrictions for keeping certain revenues in special funds also,
which funds may be used for specific purposes only. There might be plenty of money in certain of
these funds and an inadequate amount in other funds, so that bills could not be paid. This
further complicates City financial management.

The reader is referred to Schedule C. An examination of this Schedule will show how, in
the face of steadily increasing assessed valuation, the City's tax rate has been steadily decrea-
sed so that the dollars of tax revenue have been actually decreased. It will show also, how the
final results of each year's balance of revenue and expenditures, both deficit and surpluses,
are, over a period of years, balanced out, Obviously, the City's expenditures are not increa-
sing in proportion to the growth of the community. This cannot help but result in inferior pu-
blic service, by the City administration.

One third (1/3) of the entire County's assessed valuation is in the City, yet the amount
of tax money available for City purposes has been steadily decreased, as can be seen from
Schedule C, until now the City gets but $1.05 out of each $5.00 of tax collected on real estate
within the City and personal property within the City.

The reader is now referred to Schedule D which shows the comparison between total cash
on hand of the City as shown by the City books and as shown by the Bank. This schedule is
included because the Mayor has laid great stress on the amount of cash in the City account accor-
ding to the Bank records, and has questioned the necessity of making an emergency loan, with so
much money in the bank. Schedule D shows, in the column headed "Per City Books" the true
balance of cash in the City account if all checks had been presented and cashed. The difference
between these figures and the balance shown by the Bank is due to checks issued and outstanding
that have not been presented for payment. The Bank's figure cannot be a true balance until all
these checks issued have been presented and cashed. In any business of the size of the City,
such a condition rarely holds.

As a matter of fact, the amount of cash on hand has little significance alone, until it has
been related to the needs and requirements for cash that are immediately ahead or even that may
come up some months in the future.

A considerable amount of this cash may be in funds not available for ordinary expenditures
but to be used only for specific purposes, such as bond redemption and interest.

Furthermore, a certain balance of cash on hand is necessary in the nature of a revolving
fund for the payment of payroll and other monthly expenditures against the time of revenues coming
into the City control.

With these facts presented, the Commission is of the mind that there is conclusive evidence
that an emergency does exist and that it is necessary that the City have permission to make the
Emergency Loan applied for.

1941 that time is very short and that failure on the part of the City might resport in the
City losing the airport project, was the reason for the haste in the above mentioned Resolution
at this time. According to figures compiles as of 3/18/41 with the disposition of the $25,000.00
for this purpose and in view of the fact that money due and payable to the City on or before
April loth, 1941 we have arrived at the balance of $39,027.36 which we feel is sufficient to
carry the City for the next three months.

Thereupon on motion of Commissioner Ronnow seconded by Commissioner Gilbert it was moved
and carried that Warrant No. 488 be allowed in the sum of $25,000.00 and that the Mayor and
Clerk sign the same. That this amount be sent up in a separate fund as per foregoing Resolution.

Vote Commissioners Ronnow, Gilbert, Krause and Corradetti voting aye. His Honor the Mayor

ated by private enterprise and subject to normal taxation; provided, however, that the City may

opment so long as title thereto is held by the Government and so long as the emergency declared

by the President on September 8, 1939, to exist, continues; provided, however, that so long
as title to the Development is held by the Government after said emergency has terminated

Following is Mr. Smiths report:

Board of City Commissioners
Howell Garrison, Mayor

Gentlemen:

In order that my position in this all important controversial question may be
clearly understood by all concerned, I am offering as a matter of record, the following:

Consideration of numerous questions by various individuals and bodies well,
of Block 16, its regulation and disposition has been an unsolved problem several years
to my personal knowledge.

The first time this matter sprang up before the present Board of City Commissioners
that I know anything about was July 2, 1941 at which time an informal meeting was held
at the home of Mayor Garrison with Commissioners Clark, Rubidoux, Smith and Tinch
together with City Attorney Ralli and Mayor Garrison present.

The subject was introduced by Mr. Ralli who proposed an Ordinance on the basis of
an emergency whereby prostitution in Block 16, might become legalized, stating this would
make Las Vegas the first city to legalize by license, prostitution, in the United States.

I refused to cast my vote in favor of such an ordinance. This brought out
considerable discussion and argument but I declined to change my position. Mr. Ralli
said an unanimous vote was necessary to ordain an emergency ordinance. I assured them
that while I could not change my position conscientiously, I would pass my vote rather
than vote against the measure thereby take the part of a neutral. Mr. Ralli said I
could not pass my vote but could vote as I chose. I then stated I would be absent when
the matter come up for action and by doing so would not prevent an unanimous vote by my
presence. Mr. Ralli said this would not do.

At this juncture, I stated that I never would allow my name to be connected
with anything which might indicate the city of Las Vegas was legalizing prostitution by
license; knowingly.

July 3, 1941 I called at the District Attorney's office and asked Mr. Wiley what
the status of abatement proceedings instituted by Mr. J. R. Lewis were concerning Block
16. He told me the case was pending in the District Court. I called at Mr. Ralli's
office and he told me he had made a research of NCL and found that a house of prostitution
could not be located within 1200' of a church etc., and he believed the Espiscapol
Church was within that distance.

Oct. 10, 1941 Mayor Garrison issued an order directing the police department to
immediately undertake suppression of prostitution wherever it may exist within the city,
etc.

Oct. 16, Chief of Police Frank Waite, was removed from office by a 3 to 2 vote on
account of failure to comply with said order. Mr. David Mackey was appointed Chief of
Police by unanimous vote.

A short time after appointment of Chief Mackey, the County Sheriffs office
issued gaming and tavern license to Meadows resort, similar to licenses issued several
others east of Las Vegas City limits.

Issuance of the licenses to the Meadows was followed closely by a suit filed
in the District Court by a resident taxpayer in that vicinity resulting in a restraining
order being issued by Judge Hatton. Since that time Judge Watson dismissed a demurrer involved
 in this case leaving said order in full force and effect.

At a joint meeting between County and City Commissioners November 5th, the matter
of regulation of prostitution at the Meadows resort was discussed briefly at which time I,

upon request of Ira Earl, Chairman of the Board of County Commissioners, stated my views
of the matter and Mr. Ralli said, it did not make sense and nothing further was said on the
subject at that time.

Nov. 6th, 8 o'clock P.M., another joint meeting was held at the County Court House
Law Library. Those present were: Ira Earl, Mayor Garrison, Earl Davison and Rodney Colton,
County Commissioners, Pat Clark, A. L. Rubidoux , A. F. Smith, Sr., M. C. Tinch, City
Commissioners. Roland Wiley, District Attorney, Paul Ralli, City Attorney, Al Cahlan,

Review Journal, Archie C. Grant, State Senator, Bob Griffith, Secretary Chamber of Commerce,
Lloyd Payne, County Clerk, M. E. Ward, Sheriff of Clark County, Madison Graves, Mr. Cohen,

Marion Earl, Attorneys.

The object of this meeting was, discussion pertaining to the Meadows resort and
regulation thereof by the City Commissioners on the assumption it is within one mile from
City limits of Las Vegas.

While there was much said with reference to regulation, there was no mention made
of what was to constitute regulation; there were no rules presented for consideration indicating
what might be intended in the way of regulation.

To me therefore, the word "regulation" as used without rules of order to be governed
by, is ambiguous, equivocal. At any rate, after lengthy discussion by many with Mr. Cahlan
doing most of the talking, Mr. Earl, Chairman of the Board of County Commissioners and acting
chairman of the joint meeting, (after all except myself had expressed that the place should
be regulated by the city as their belief) requested me to state my views of the question.

In response to his request, while I was alone in disagreement, I, in substance, had
the following to say:

The County issued the licenses - there is a case pending in the District Court and we
should wait until the law takes its course at least - On the other hand, if the people who
are qualified property owners in that district see fit to petition the city commissioners, in
compliance with State Statutes and the City Charter, to extend the city limits so as to take
in that territory which extends a sizable distance beyond the Meadows building in an easterly,
northerly and southerly direction, Ordinance No. 194 without amendment, will automatically
take care of the situation. In this event, in order to get away from possible closing
through influence of Ordinance 194, they will necessarily have to move the resort more than one
mile from its present location. If we take advantage of the authority vested in the city
through its charter and amend ordinance 194 or ordain another ordinance extending juris-
diction one mile beyond the city limits, the resort would not be required to move but a short
distance to get out of city jurisdiction where the county might grant them another license
which would return the whole matter right back to the point from which we started and to
which I am opposed.

Nov. 5. Police officer Horner appeared at my home with a letter addressed to Paul
Ralli, City Attorney, signed by Mayor Garrison, Commissioners Clark, Rubidoux and Tinch,
stating that Mr. Ralli had sent him to me with the letter for my signature which had for
its purpose a request upon the city attorney to prepare an ordinance or amendment which
would upon approval, carry jurisdiction of the city Commissioners one mile beyond the city
limits. I declined to affix my signature to the document and told the officer to advise Mr.
Ralli that my position was, at this time, the same as it was at the joint meeting of Nov. 6,
1941.

The Review-Journal of December 9, 1941, Page 2, carries an article as follows:

"A complaint was filed by District Attorney Roland H. Wiley in justice Court in
Las Vegas today against E. V. Clippinger and H. E. Crain, charging that they are
maintaining a disorderly house at the Meadows. Anthony Messina is the complaining witness
in the case."

I quote the following taken from a publication in Washington, D.C., dated November
25, 1941.

"An alarming and costly outbreak of venereal diseases among service men is blamed
on army and navy BRASS HATS in a book written by Surgeon General Thomas Parran of the
United States Public Health Service, and just off the press. Parran advocates the complete
suppression of prostitutes in military camps and defence areas, but declares that 80 per
cent of army commanders favor the regulation of vice, notwithstanding an effort to bring it
under control during the last war was a tragic failure.- Three months ago congress passed
legislation making it possible to drive prostitutes away from the vicinity of camps, but Parran
says no attempt at enforcement has been made. - Prior to Defense mobilization, Parran asserts,
the commercial prostitute was barely breaking even with amateur and part-time competition.
Suddenly the situation has been reversed. The vice rings saw a vast and profitable field
of operation. -The recruitment of prostitutes has kept pace with the recruitment of the
army. It is one of our most expanded war industries."

I quote the following taken from December issue of Readers Digest Page 15.

"Realistic army men have no illusions about abolishing prostitution overnight. The
army estimates that 15 percent of its men are incorrigibles. Another 15 percent are
abstainers, being married, engaged, fearful or disinterested. The remaining 70 percent
are subject to occasional lapses; and the group the Army is particularly interested in
protecting, Professional prostitutes are responsible for practically all venereal diseases."

Nov. 21, 1941 a proposed ordinance relating to prostitution and regulation thereof
was introduced for consideration and was approved for its first reading by a 3 to 2 vote.

Mayor Garrison and myself voted in the negative on this occasion.

My position at this time remains unchanged and will continue as such under the
foregoing conditions and circumstances until and unless there may be substantial reason
produced to justify a change.

Respectfully submitted, December 16, 1941.

LAS VEGAS, NEVADA
MAY 18, 1942

At a recessed regular meeting of the Board of City Commissioners held this 18th day of
May, 1942. Meeting called to order by Mayor Howell C. Garrison, at the hour of 7:30 P.M.,
with the following members present: Commissioners Clark, Rubidoux, Smith, Tinch. City
Attorney, Paul Ralli, Purchasing Agent, LeRoy Whipple, City Auditor, A. W. Blackman and
city clerk Helen Scott Reed.

Minutes of the previous meetings of May 5th and 16th were read.

Said minutes were ordered amended to show that the Mayor passed his vote on the purchase of
a lawn mower for the cemetery department for consideration. After consideration re-opened
said motion and voted yes. Further ORDERED corrected to show that Mr. Fredericks, Dunlap
and Hartford were hired in the police department to replace men who had left the force.

Mr. Matheson was hired on special assignment. Thereafter the Minutes were approved as
amended and corrected.

Commissioner Smith presented the following written statement prepared by himself which was,
at his request, ORDERED spread on the Minutes.

"This has reference to Mayor Garrison passing his vote on a motion to purchase a
lawn mower from the lowest bidder at a recessed meeting held May 5, 1942 and before adjourn-
ment of said meeting, after consultation with the city attorney and others, changing his
vote which reversed the status of the motion throwing sale to the highest bidder.

At a Board Meeting held June 11, 1941 I offered a suggestion along with several
others, as follows:

'Since there does not seem to be any established "ORDER OF BUSINESS" nor "RULES OF
ORDER" governing conduct of our meetings, in order that we may proceed in an orderly fashion,

thereby expedite transaction of the business of our meetings, I respectfully suggest for
your consideration, adoption of "ROBERT'S RULES OF ORDER" as a governing factor of our Board

	
City Commissioners.

While the Minutes do not show the foregoing suggestion was taken as a motion
and voted on as I remember; since that time, we have however, been furnished with an order
of business at our regular meetings at least, by the city clerk and I believe we have
consistently followed Robert's Rules in our conduct and I doubt the wisdom of ignoring them
at this time.

Section 41, Page 130 of said rules provides as follows: "The Clerk should, previous to each
meeting, for use of the Chairman, make out an order of business, showing in their exact order what
is necessary to come before the assembly."

The city clerk has exceeded this requirement as an accommodation by furnishing each member
of the Board a copy of such order of business to her credit in my way of thinking.

Section 38, Page 111, provides: "A member has the right to change his vote (when not made
by ballot) before the decision of the question has been finally and conclusively pronounced by
the chair, but not afterwards."

"Until the negative is put, it is in order for any member, in the same manner as if the
voting had not been commenced, to rise and speak, make motions for amendment or otherwise,
and thus renew the debate; and this, whether the member was in the assembly room or not when
the question was put and the vote partly taken. After the chairman has announced the vote,
if it is found that a member has risen and addressed the chair before the negative had been
put, he is entitled to be heard on the question, the same as though the vote had not been
taken. In such cases the question is in the same condition as if it had never been put."

RECONSIDER

SECTION 27, Page 73. "It is in order at any time, even when another member has the floor,
or while the assembly is voting on the motion to adjourn, during the day on which a motion
has been acted upon, or the next succeeding day, * Note. If the vote is not reconsidered
on the day it was taken, and no meeting is held the next day, then it cannot be reconsidered at
the next meeting. The proper course then is to renew the motion if it failed or rescind it
if it had been adopted (This motion was adopted by an improper vote in my opinion).

RESCIND

SECTION 25. Page 71. "When an assembly wishes to annul some action it has previously
taken and it is too late to reconsider the vote, the proper course to pursue is to rescind
the objectionable resolution, order or other proceeding. The motion has no privilege but
stands on a footing with a new resolution. Any action of the body can be rescinded regardless
of the time that has elapsed.

NOTE: "When it is desired not only to rescind the action but to express very strong disapproval,
legislative bodies have on rare occasions voted to rescind the objectionable resolution and
expunge it from the record, which is done by crossing out the words, or drawing a line around
them and writing across them the words "Expunged by order of the assembly, etc", giving the
date of the order."

Signed: Arthur F. Smith, Sr.
