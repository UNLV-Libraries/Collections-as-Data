suance of tavern liquor and retail liquor licenses shall be based on population, limiting the number of
licenses issued to one, whether tavern or retail, to each 750 population in the City of Las Vegas, Nevada,

granted a similar license by the City as that which the said licensee had prior to the time of annexation;
provided that the applicant is approved for holding a license by the City Commission.

If any license provided for in this section should be revoked for any reason, no new license shall be
issued until the population of the City of Las Vegas is such that the terms of this section can be com-
plied with.
