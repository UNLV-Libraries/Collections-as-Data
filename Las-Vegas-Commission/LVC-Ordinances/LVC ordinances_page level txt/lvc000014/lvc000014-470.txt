braced within the special assessment district created by Ordinance No. 409 of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada.

Section 2. In no case shall the amount of any special assessment upon any such lot or premises exceed 50%

Fund.

Section 3. The Ex-Officio City Assessor of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, shall prepare an assessment roll
in the manner provided by the Charter of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, and shall assess each lot and parcel of
land embraced within the aforementioned special assessment districts according to the frontage.

Section 4. After the special assessment roll, as herein provided for, shall have been prepared and comple-
ted, the Ex-Officio City Assessor shall report the same to the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas,
Nevada, and thereafter it shall be filed in the office of the City Clerk, and numbered, and the Board of Commis-
sioners shall cause notice thereof to the persons whose names appear upon the assessment roll, and to all others
interested therein, to be published for at least two weeks in some newspaper published in the City of Las Vegas,
Nevada, of the time when the Board of Commissioners and the Ex-Officio City Assessor will meet to review the as-
sessments, and any person, objecting to the assessments, may file his objections thereto with the City Clerk.

Section 5. At the time appointed for reviewing the assessments, the Board of Commissioners and the Ex-Offi-

assessments and correct the same, and confirm it as corrected, or confirm it as reported, or annul it, and direct
a new assessment to be made.

Section 6. When the assessments shall be confirmed as herein provided, it shall be final and conclusive.

The City Clerk shall thereupon deliver to the County Assessor, acting Ex-Officio City Assessor, the Assessment
Roll as confirmed by the Board of Commissioners, with his certificate of such confirmation, and of the date there-
of. The County Assessor, acting Ex-Officio City Assessor, shall thereupon, without extra compensation, record
such Assessment Roll in his office, and append thereto his certificate of the date of such recording, whereupon
from said date all persons shall be deemed to have notice of the contents of such Assessment Roll, and it shall
be prima facie evidence in all courts and tribunals of the regularity of all proceedings preliminary to the making
thereof, and of the validity of the assessment and Assessment Roll. After the Assessment has been confirmed and
recorded, the several amounts levied thereon have been confirmed and recorded, the several amounts levied thereon
shall become at once due and payable, and shall constitute and be a lien upon the respective lots and parcels of
land, and improvements assessed, and shall be charged against the persons and properties until paid.

Treasurer and Tax Receiver of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, and be by that officer paid into and credited to the
special fund to be known as and called "Las Vegas Street Improvement Assessment District #100-7 Fund".

Section 8. All costs and expenses incurred in making the improvements shall be charged to and paid out of
said fund, provided, however, that all monies drawn on the General Fund of the City of Las Vegas to defray any of
the costs and expenses of making the improvements, or, if it shall become necessary to draw upon the General Fund
to defray any of the costs and expenses of the improvements, except as otherwise provided by the Charter of the
City of Las Vegas, Nevada, the General Fund shall be reimbursed by transfer of funds from the "Las Vegas Street
Improvement Assessment District #100-7 Fund" as soon as conditions of the same will permit.
