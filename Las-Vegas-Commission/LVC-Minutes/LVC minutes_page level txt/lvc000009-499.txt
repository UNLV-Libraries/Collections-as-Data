This being the time set for report on the status of the use permit granted Dr. J. H.
Swartzfager et al to erect a one-story building for medical offices on the west side
of Rancho Road between Charleston Boulevard and Palomino Lane, approved by the
Commission on March 30, 1955 and an appeal having thereafter been filed by protestants,

His Honor asked that the attorney for the objectors present her reasons for appeal.

Mrs. Jeanne Houssels appeared before the Commission at this time and spoke briefly on
the objections of her clients, Mr. and Mrs. Connie Hurley, Mr. and Mrs. Charlie Teel
and others signing the appeal for rehearing. Mrs. Houssels also filed a written report
on the basis of her argument for rehearing. She further pointed out certain ambiguities
in the planning and zoning ordinance concerning the time for objections to and filing
of appeals from use permits, and requested another hearing on this matter.

Mr. Bruce Beckley, representing the applicants for the use permit, also was present and
stated that he felt that sufficient hearings had been held on this application. He
indicated that the protestants had not appeared at the proper time to voice or file their
objections.

Howard W. Cannon, City Attorney, reported that there were certain ambiguities in our
ordinance, but further stated that he felt that the Commission had properly followed the
procedural steps in this instance.

Thereafter Commissioner Sharp moved that appeal for additional hearing not be considered
further, and the action of the Commission of March 30, 1955 granting said permit stand.
