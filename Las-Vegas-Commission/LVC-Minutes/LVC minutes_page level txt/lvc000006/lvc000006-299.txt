Gentlemen:

After studying the proposal of Mr. Lawren W. Gibbs in connection with
his offer to purchase the $350,000.00 Sewer Disposal Plant Bonds upon
being paid $5.00 per $100.00 on the Bonds Issued for his services in
connection therewith, and the City's conditional acceptance conditioned
upon the approval of all proceedings, resolutions and ordinance in
connection therewith by the City Attorney of the City of Las Vegas, it
is my opinion that such a procedure would be unconstitutional and void.

Senate Bill No. 84 of the 1947 Session of the Legislature amending the
Charter of the City of Las Vegas as found on Page 320 of the 1947 Statutes
of Nevada, referring to "Sewage Bonds" provides, "Said bonds shall be sold
at not less than their par value and shall be redeemable in the order
of their Issuance within twenty-five years of their date of issue .............."

In addition thereto, Section 6087 N.C.L. 1929 provides in part that any
bonds issued by a municipal corporation shall be sold at not less than
par and accrued interest, nor at any discount or commission be allowed
or paid on the sale of such bonds.

It is my opinion that an agreement wherein the City of Las Vegas would
agree to pay a commission of $5.00 per $100.00 of the bonds sold would
constitute a sale at a discount and be unlawful.

It is my opinion that the City of Las Vegas through its Board of Commissioners
does not have the authority to enter into an agreement for the sale of said
bonds at a discount, and, therefore, the proposal, resolution and conditional
acceptance is not approved by your City Attorney, because such acceptance
is contrary to the law.

Respectfully submitted,

C. Norman Cornwall /s

C. Norman Cornwall,

City Attorney
