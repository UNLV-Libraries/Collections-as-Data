Second; I find upon examination of Ordinance 47. relating to grades and Sidewalk s that the sidewalk 

prayed for in the petition if constructed must be ten feet wide in the front of blocks 2&3 and five

feet wide in front of blocks 1,4,5,6,7,&8, thus making the improvement cost twice as much in front

of blocks 2&3 as it will in front of Blocks 14,5,6,7,&8. I have consulted with the City Attorney

and he advises me that he make the proposed improvement in one assessment District would make an
unjust assessment roll on the front foot rule of assessments, and on his advice I have prepared plat

and estimate on two separate Assessment District the one to be called Assessment District No. 5.
Comprising Blocks 1,4,5,6,7,&8 and the other to be Called Assessment District No. 6 Comprising blocks
No's 2&3. Which are submitted as follows, towit: Assessed Valuation will carry the cost on 20% assess-
ment .
