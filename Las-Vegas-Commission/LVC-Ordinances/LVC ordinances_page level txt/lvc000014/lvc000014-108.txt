ORDINANCE NO. 240

"AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS REGULATING THE PRESENTATION AND AUDIT OF
CLAIMS AND DEMANDS AGAINST THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS; AND PROVIDING FOR THEIR ALLOWANCE
AND PAYMENT OR REJECTION." 

The Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas do ordain as follows:

Section 1. The word "demand" as used in this ordinance shall mean
"demand, claim or account"; and the word "person" shall mean "person, public
officer, firm, corporation, company or association."

Section 2. No City officer shall, except for his own service, or
expenses incurred by him on behalf of the City, present any demand for allowance
against the City, or in any way, except in the discharge of his official duty, ad-
vocate the relief asked in a demand made by any other person. Any person may appear
before the Board of Commissioners and oppose the allowance of any demand made
against the city.

Section 3. No demand on the City of Las Vegas shall be allowed by
the Board of Commissioners in favor of any person in any way indebted to the City
of Las Vegas, without first deducting such indebtedness, nor in favor of any of-
ficer whose account shall not have been rendered and approved, or who shall have
neglected or refused to perform any of the duties of his office.

Section 4. The Board of Commissioners must not hear, consider,
credit, audit or allow any demand in favor of any person against the city, unless
the same is itemized, giving names, dates and particular services rendered, char-
acter of work done, number of days engaged, supplies or materials furnished, to
whom, and quantity and price to be paid therefor, duly certified by the claimant
as follows; "I certify that this demand is true and correct; is unpaid and due

this claimant in the sum of $............" and unless the same is presented to and

filed with the City Clerk of the City of Las Vegas within six (6) months after the
last item of the demand accrued. If the Board of Commissioners does not hear or
consider a demand for the reason that it is not itemized or certified, the Board
of Commissioners shall cause notice to be given to the claimant or his attorney of
that fact, and shall give time to have the same itemized and certified, provided

that in no case shall such time be enlarged or given beyond the original six months
limitation above mentioned.
