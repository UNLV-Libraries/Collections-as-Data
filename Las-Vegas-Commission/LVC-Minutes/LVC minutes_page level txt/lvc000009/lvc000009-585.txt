City Manager A. H. Kennedy stated that the License Department is holding money from
various application for tavern and package liquor licenses which have not been acted

ment be authorized to refund this money.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the money being held in deposit by the License Depart-
ment on applications for limited liquor licenses be refunded.

Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

City Manager Kennedy said that a preliminary survey had been made on the Girl Scouts'
Building in Squires Park. Commissioner Sharp and Mr. Wade had gone over the ground
with the Girl Scout officials. He further stated that the property would adjoin the
parking lot of the State Building and would be 90' x 90'.

Mr. Kennedy was authorized to proceed with this matter and present the proposed lease
with the Girl Scouts at the next regular meeting of the Commission.

City Manager Kennedy presented the matter of a publication compiled by R. E. Barringer
entitled "Building Code Digest", which is represented to be an official booklet on
building and planning ordinances of the City of Las Vegas.

The City Attorney was instructed to prepare a resolution setting forth that this
"Building Code Digest" is not an official document of the City and that notice be
published in the newspapers to this effect. The resolution is as follows:

WHEREAS, it has come to the attention of the Board of City Commissioners that a
Building Code Digest has been issued by R. E. BARRINGER, publisher; compiled and
produced by ADCO PUBLISHING COMPANY, and

WHEREAS, it appears that advertising has been sold therein on the representation that
said booklet is an official publication of the City of Las Vegas; and

WHEREAS, said document is not an official publication of the City and the City assumes
no responsibility for the accuracy of the representations made therein;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the City Clerk cause a public notice to be
published advising the general public that the said Building Code Digest is not an
official city document and is in no way sponsored by the City of Las Vegas nor does
the City assume any responsibility for the matters contained therein.

The Commission was advised by the City Manager that four bids had been received for the
purchase of a flushing truck and auxiliary piece of fire equipment. Mr. Kennedy stated
that the bids were as follows:

1)	CASHMAN GMC TRUCK CO. - CMC truck with a steel tank can be delivered in
70 days at a total cost of $7,933.00.

2)	CLARK COUNTY WHOLESALE - International Harvester truck at a total cost of
$8,425.21 delivered within 30 to 45 days. Mr. Kennedy stated that this
truck would be overloaded when the tanks are filled.

3)	CLARK COUNTY WHOLESALE - International Harvester truck delivered within
30 to 45 days, at a total cost of $9,015.35.

4)	FOULGER EQUIPMENT CO. - This bid was only on the flushing equipment, and
did not include the truck.

Mr. Kennedy recommended that the second bid of Clark County Wholesale in the total
amount of $9,015.35 be accepted because of the early delivery date and because this
bid was the only one that met the City's specifications.

Commissioner Bunker moved the recommendation of the City Manager be accepted and Bid.

No. 55.15 be awarded to Clark County Wholesale in the amount of $9,015.35.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Bunker moved this meeting adjourn.
