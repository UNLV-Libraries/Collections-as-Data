Mr. Wade stated that he was of the opinion that this was the only way this could be
accomplished since the water rights on the McNeil well had never been properly revoked
by the State Engineer and he had been further advised by the State Engineer that the
proper steps had not been taken in previous years to revoke this water right. He said
that he had been advised by the State Engineer that no new rights would be granted for
irrigation purposes in this area.

solution can be worked out.
