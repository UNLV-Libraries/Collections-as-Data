provided, that all such assessments, or any part thereof, may, at the election of
the owner, be paid in installments, with interest, as hereinafter provided. Failure 
to pay the whole assessment, or any part thereof, within said period of four
weeks shall be conclusively considered and held an election on the part of all
persons interested, whether under disability of otherwise, to pay in such installments. 
In case of such election to pay in installments, the unpaid assessments
shall be payable at the office of said Ex-Officio City Treasurer in ten substantially 
equal annual installments of principal, the first of which installments of
principal shall be due and payable on or before the 1st day of April, 1959; and
the remainder of said installments shall be due and payable successively on or
before the same day in each year thereafter until paid in full, with interest in
all cases on the unpaid deferred installments of principal from the 1st day of
April, 1958, at the same rate of interest as that provided for in the special as-
sessment bond to be hereafter authorized, sold, issued and delivered, but not to
exceed seven per centum (7%) per annum, payable annually at the office of said
Ex-Officio City Treasurer, the first annual payment of interest being due and
payable on the 1st day of April, 1959; and the remainder of said annual installments 
of interest being due and payable on the 1st day of April in each year
thereafter. Failure to pay any installment, whether of principal or interest,
when due, shall cause the whole of the unpaid principal to became due and payable
immediately, and the whole amount of the unpaid principal and accrued interest
shall thereafter bear penalty at the rate of ten per centum (10%) per annum, until 
the day of sale, but at any time prior to the day of the sale, the owner may
pay the amount of all unpaid installments, with interest thereon at ten per centum
(10%) per annum, and all penalties accrued, and shall thereupon be restored to the
right thereafter to pay in installments in the same manner as if default had not
been suffered. The owner of any property not in default as to any installment
or payment, may, at any time, pay the whole of the unpaid principal with interest
accruing thereon to the next interest paying date.

Each assessment, together with interest thereon, shall be placed on the
tax roll of Clark County on and against the several owners and premises, and the
County Assessor of Clark County, Acting Ex-Officio Assessor of the City of Las
Vegas, is hereby authorized and directed to enter the same on the tax roll of said
County and to extend the same in a special column for special assessments on said
tax roll, and the County Treasurer of said County, the Ex-Officio City Treasurer
and Ex-Officio Tax Collector of the City of Las Vegas, is hereby authorized and
directed to collect the same, all in the same manner and at the same time as
other State and County taxes are collected.

SECTION 2. That all action (Not inconsistent with the provisions of
this Ordinance) heretofore taken by the City of Las Vegas, and the officers of
said City, directed toward the improving of East Charleston Boulevard by the 
laying of oil bound gravel pavement thereon, and by constructing on both sides 
thereof concrete curbs and gutters and concrete valley gutters wherever necessary, and
installing sidewalks and street lighting along the same in the said Street Improvement 
Assessment District No. 100-35; toward the creation of said District, and
toward levying and effecting special assessments to defray the entire cost thereof,
be, and the same is hereby ratified, approved and confirmed.

SECTION 3. That if any one or more sections, sentences, clauses or parts
of this ordinance shall, for any reason, be questioned or be held invalid, such
judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remaining provisions of this
ordinance, but shall be confined in its operation to the specific sections, sentences, 
clauses or parts of the ordinance so held unconstitutional and invalid,
and the inapplicability and invalidity of any section, sentence, clause of part
of this ordinance, in any one or more instances shall not affect or prejudice in
any way the applicability and validity of this ordinance in any other instances.

SECTION 4. That by reason of the fact that the streets of the City of
Las Vegas are inadequate to meet the present and future needs of the City and
its inhabitants and that it is necessary immediately to raise funds to improve
said street, therefore, it is hereby declared that an emergency exists, and that
this ordinance is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace,
health and safety.

SECTION 5. That the City Clerk and Clerk of the Board of Commissioners
of the City of Las Vegas shall cause this ordinance to be published once a week
for two successive weeks immediately following its final reading and adoption, in
the Las Vegas Review Journal, a daily newspaper published in said City, and this
ordinance shall become effective immediately following the second publication
thereof.
