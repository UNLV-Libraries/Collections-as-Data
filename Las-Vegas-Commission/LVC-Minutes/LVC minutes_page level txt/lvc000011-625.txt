Commissioner Sharp stated this hotel had served a good function over there and
he concurred with Commissioner Fountain that, unless it could he definitely
for the purpose of an inter-racial hotel and not he restricted, this application
should he denied. He stated, further, he believed the applicant and the people
on the Westside should get together and get the matter straightened out.
Commissioner Fountain withdrew his motion to deny this application.

Commissioner Sharp moved the application of Karl and Leo Frey (Leroy Corp.)
for a Tavern License and license for four slot machines at the Moulin Rouge
Hotel, 900 West Bonanza, be held in abeyance.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Elwell and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson
voting aye; noes, none.

CASH PAYOUT 	Commissioner Fountain stated that some weeks ago Mr. Doig from the Showboat

PINBALL MACHINE	Hotel had asked him to come down to the Showboat Lanes and look at the bowling

POLICY	alleys, as he was interested in putting in two Automatic Payoff Pinball

Machines. He added he had done so and found the area in which he desired to
City Manager	place these machines was well-lighted and there was a man stationed within

to Investigate	ten feet. He added that this gentlemen had asked if he could come in and

discuss this matter with the Commission.

Jean Dutton, Supervisor of License and Revenue, stated that since the pinball
machines came out, it had been the policy that they not be permitted in places
where minors are allowed.

Mr. Doig stated that no official ruling had been made for or against the Automatic
Pinball Machine. He added they are a new type machine and should be classified
as a slot machine because of the cash payoff; however, they still came under the
ruling of a pinball machine and are licensed as a slot machine.

Mr. Kennedy stated according to the policy adopted by the Commission, these
machines were treated as a slot machine and were not to be placed where
minors were allowed. He suggested this policy could be changed if the Commission
so desired. Commissioner Sharp suggested perhaps this policy should be reviewed.

Commissioner Fountain stated, if it was permissible, he would like to have the
City Manager check this situation in regard to the Showboat location and also
to investigate this policy concerning the Payoff Pinball Machines.

FARM-CITY WEEK	Commissioner Whipple advised that he had been approached by Ferren Bunker of

PROCLAMATION	the local Clark County Agricultural Extension Service, requesting the City of

Las Vegas to proclaim the week of November 20 through November 26, 1959 as
Approved	"Farm-City Week" for the purpose of creating better public relations between

city and rural areas. He added it had also been requested that the Mayor
and Commissioners appear on some of the farms in the surrounding area.

The Commissioners expressed their approval of this program and instructed the
City Attorney to prepare an appropriate proclamation.
