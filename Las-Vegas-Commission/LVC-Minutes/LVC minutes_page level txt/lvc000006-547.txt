ORDINANCE NO. 107

whereas, the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, at a regular recessed
meeting thereof held on the 25th day of April, 1947, unanimously adopted the following resolution,
to-wit:

"WHEREAS, the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, through its Mayor and Board
of Commissioners joined with the Mayors, City Commissioners, and County
Commissioners, of several cities and counties in the State of Nevada in
urging the passage of a bill by the legislature of the State of Nevada
providing for the levying and collecting of an excise tax of l 1/2¢ per gallon
on motor vehicle fuel sold in the State of Nevada, for the purpose of pro-
viding funds to enable the Cities and Counties of this State to construct,
maintain and repair the public highways and roads therein, and

WHEREAS, a Bill providing for such excise tax was introduced and the
Mayor and City Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas traveled to Carson City
strongly urging the passage of said Bill as a measure of deep concern to the
welfare of the City of Las Vegas, and

WHEREAS, said bill was enacted into law and will be in full force and
effect from and after July 1, 1947, and

WHEREAS, the funds derived from taxes and now available for the improve-
ment and maintenance of City streets is insufficient for said purposes and the
City is sorely in need of additional funds therefor, and

WHEREAS, through the enforcement of this act the sum of approximately
One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($160,000.00) will be available to the county,
of which Fifty (50) per cent will be available to the City of Las Vegas for street
improvements, and

WHEREAS, tourists will provide approximately Seventy-five (75) per cent of
the tax so levied and collected under the provisions of said act, and

WHEREAS, many other governing bodies throughout the United States have
resorted to similar taxation to provide their cities with funds for street
and road improvements, and

WHEREAS, under the provisions of this act the County Commissioners may
decline to accept the tax provided by the act by the adoption of a resolution
passed prior to the effective date of said act,

NOW, THEREFOR, be it resolved by the Board of Commissioners of the City
of Las Vegas in regular session that it respectfully urge and request the Board
of County Commissioners of the County of Clark, Nevada, to adopt a resolution
to accept the benefits of said act thus providing the necessary funds to enable
the city of Las Vegas to improve its streets and roads as in said act provided,
and be it further

RESOLVED that a copy of this resolution be spread on the minutes of this
board, and a copy of said resolution be sent to the Board of Commissioners of the
County of Clark, and the clerk of this board is so ordered to do.",

and

WHEREAS, the Board of County Commissioners of the County of Clark, Nevada, subsequently
by the adoption of a resolution passed prior to the effective date of said Act, declined to
accept the tax provided in said Act, and

WHEREAS, said Act provides that the County Commissioners shall reconsider and pass
said resolution, declining to accept the tax provided in said Act, once each year within
sixty (60) days prior to July 1 of each year as long as said County Commissioners desire so to
act, and

WHEREAS, the funds derived from taxes and now available for the improvement and
maintenance of city streets is still insufficient for said purposes and the City is still in
sore need of additional funds therefor, and, as based on all reasonable estimates, it is anti-
cipated that said fiscal condition will remain the same on, and for some time after, July 1,

1948, and be it further

RESOLVED that a copy of this Resolution be spread on the Minutes of this Board, and
a copy of said Resolution be sent to the Board of County Commissioners of the County of Clark,
Nevada, and the clerk of this Board is so ordered to do.
