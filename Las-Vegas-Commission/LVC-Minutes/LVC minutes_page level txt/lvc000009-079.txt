or the defraying of the entire cost and expense by special assessments; and

WHEREAS, objections, suggestions, comments and questions were made or raised at
said protest hearing as follows:

The Las Vegas Land and Water Company submitted written objections

1)	That the plans were not filed with the City Clerk on March 31, 1954;

preservation of public peace, health and safety;
