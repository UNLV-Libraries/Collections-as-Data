Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Bunker, Fountain, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent: Commissioner Sharp.

At this time the City Manager Kennedy presented the proposal to improve 12 blocks within the
downtown area by the installation of a gravel base, which was never installed in these
particular blocks, and a new top coat of oil. Mr. Kennedy advised the Commission that the
oil paving would cost the property owners approximately $1.80 per front foot, and recommended
that the gravel base be installed at the City's expense.

The Commission discussed the matter and advised the City Manager they were interested in
having more through streets and requested improvement of those streets that are developing
traffic. They further requested that the Engineering Department work out a program with
the money that is available, with these facts in mind.

Assistant City Attorney Ralston Hawkins requested advice from the Commission concerning the
property owned by Mrs. Susan Mankiewicz, which is required by the City for the completion
of the Owens Avenue grade crossing. Mr. Hawkins reported that this property is 330 feet
in length, and an appraisal has been made.

The Commission authorized the City Attorney's office to negotiate with the owner of this
property, and granted permission to offer $4500.00 for the purchase.

There being no further business to come before the Board, the meeting adjourned.

14, 63 through 70, 73 through 78, Block 27; and Lots 4l and 42,

Block 26, all in Charleston Heights No. 4.

His Honor asked for discussion on this matter.

Mr. Kell Houssels, Jr., representing Mr. Van Buskirk appeared before the Commission at
this time and stated that his client came to Las Vegas with the intent of building fifty
homes and investing $100,000.00 in this construction. He reported that Mr. Van Buskirk
had investigated the area and had purchased fifty lots 60' x 100' and proposed to construct
a house such as he had built in California on exactly the same size of a lot. Mr. Van
Buskirk checked and found that the City requirements of a 23' front yard and 23' back yard
could be met, so he then purchased the lots in Charleston Heights #4. Mr. Houssels also
reported that his client at this time received FHA committments and secured financing, sub-
mitted detailed plans to FHA and was then notified that FHA required the staggering of the
