ANIMAL SHELTER	The City Manager advised the Commission that the City Attorney had drafted a

	letter which was submitted to the Clark County Humane Society setting forth the

list of creditors and amounts that the Board of Commissioners would consider
paying, and the conditions under which they would be paid by the City. The
City Manager further advised that he had been informally advised that at a
regular meeting of the Clark County Humane Society on Monday, January 20th,
the Humane Society had indicated general approval of the conditions and amounts
as set forth in the City Attorney's letter. Question was raised concerning four
of the building creditors who were subsequently personally checked by the City
Manager's office and a final amount definitely determined. The City Manager
advised the Board that on the basis of the revision of the four building creditors 
and determination of the actual amount owed the Department of Internal
Revenue as of February 5, 1958, the revised total obligation to be incurred by
the City is $13,682.34.

Commissioner Fountain moved that as soon as the City Attorney obtains papers
from the Clark County Humane Society releasing the building and all personal
property at the Animal Shelter to the City, that the City Manager and City Attorney
