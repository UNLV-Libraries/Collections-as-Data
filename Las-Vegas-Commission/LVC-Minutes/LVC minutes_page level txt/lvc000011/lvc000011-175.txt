AMBULANCE SERVICE	The City Manager advised the Commission that there are two applications on file

LICENSES	for license for ambulance service, as follows:

DOCTORS' & EMERGENCY AMBULANCE SERVICE Dale Henry 1412 Fremont

EMERGENCY AMBULANCE SERVICE Wm.E. Curtis 600 West Bonanza

Mr. Kennedy stated that he felt there should be more than one ambulance service 
in the City of Las Vegas, but he believes that a more thorough check as to
what these applicants have to offer in the way of service should be made before
the Commission takes action on the applications.

Commissioner Fountain moved these two applications for ambulance service be held
in abeyance until more information is developed.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting
aye; noes, none. Absent:	Mayor Baker.

TAXI LICENSE -	At this time consideration was given to the application of Bayne Simpson, Desert

Desert Cab Co.	Cab Company for a taxicab license. A report was made to the Commission concerning 

Denied	the previous arrest record of Mr. Simpson.

Commissioner Sharp moved that on the grounds that the records show the applicant
has a long history of arrests, and the granting of a taxicab license would not
be consistent with the protection of the public welfare, as the business of a
taxicab operator is directly affected with the public interest, the application
of Bayne Simpson for a license for one taxicab, doing business as Desert Cab Company, 
313½ North Main Street, be denied.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	

Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting
aye; noes, none. Absent:	Mayor Baker.

ASSESSMENT DISTRICT 	City Attorney Cannon presented the agreement with the State Highway Department
NO. 100-35	relative to participation by the State of Nevada in specified costs for the

Agreement with State	improvements on Charleston Boulevard, designated as Assessment District No. 100-35.

Highway Department	

Mr. Kennedy explained that the reason for the delay in presenting this agreement,
executed by the State officials, was that the agreement originally prepared and
submitted to the Highway Department had been mislaid.

Commissioner Sharp moved the agreement with the State of Nevada, Highway Department 
for the installation of certain improvements in Assessment District No. 100-35,
 be approved and the Mayor and Clerk authorized to sign same.
