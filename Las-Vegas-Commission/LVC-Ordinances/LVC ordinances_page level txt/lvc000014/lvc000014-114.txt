whose names appear thereon, and to all persons interested, of the time when said
Board of Commissioners and Ex-officio City Assessor will meet to review the assess-
ment at which time the said Board of Commissioners shall hear any and all sugges-
tions and objections that may be filed against the said assessment, and shall at
