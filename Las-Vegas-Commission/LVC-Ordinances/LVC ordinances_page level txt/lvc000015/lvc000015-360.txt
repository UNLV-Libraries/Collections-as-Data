required for not to exceed one forty-five (45°) degree change of direction or one forty-five (45°) degree

(c) Each cleanout shall be installed so that the cleanout opens in a direction opposite to the flow of
the soil or waster, or at right angles.

cessible, and so located as to serve the purpose for which it is intended.
