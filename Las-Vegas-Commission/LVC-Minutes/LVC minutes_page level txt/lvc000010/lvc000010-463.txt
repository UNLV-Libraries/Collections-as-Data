City Engineer George E. Wade reported to the Commission that Bid No. 57.8 for the land-
scaping and improvement of Hyde Park Circle had been analyzed and he was ready to report
at this time. Mr. Wade stated that the only bid received, that of Goto Landscaping &
Nursery Co., was incomplete in that there was no bid on sidewalks, the drinking foun-
tains, curbs and gravel.

The City Engineer further reported that he had contacted contractors other than land-
scaping contractors and firms and had negotiated bids as requested by the Commission
on March 20, 1957. Mr. Wade advised the Board that the negotiated bids had been re-
ceived, and it was his recommendation that each portion of the proposed improvement
of Hyde Park Circle be awarded to separate contractors.

Commissioner Whipple moved that the bid of Goto Landscaping & Nursery Co. on Bid No.

57.8 in the total amount of $10,735.00 be rejected since it was incomplete.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent:	Commissioner

Fountain.

Commissioner Sharp moved the bid of Nevada Lawn and Irrigation Co. on Bid No. 57.7,

Part B, for the installation of the sprinkler system in Hyde Park Circle in the total
amount of $11,334.09 be accepted, and the Mayor and Clerk authorized to sign the con-
  tract.
