ASSESSMENT DISTRICT
No. 100-27

Construction bids

information was right, I would say "yes". In view of
the fact that we have not been able to make contact
with one of the men who made the borings or find him,
and since in line with the City Attorney's informa-
tion that the man would be a necessary witness, I
would say, go ahead and settle.

MR. WHIPPLE -	Is it worth anything to you to renegotiate, percentage-

wise or proportionately, the fees the City agreed to
pay you?

MR. PERLITER -	I am a professional man, an engineer, and I do not

want to go to Court. One point I would like to settle
is that such a low bid has required additional ex-
pense to me. I had to do a lot more work than I had
contemplated. I want to work with the City and I
still feel suited to carry the job to completion. I
never have had a bad job yet.

MR. WHIPPLE -	Wade and Perliter should get together and work out

one or two objects for renegotiating and then have a
full Board present and meet on it.

MR. PERLITER -	I would like time to think about the $5,000.00 figure

and talk to my attorney.

MR. WHIPPLE -	I think it is important to get this done as soon as

possible, and would like to see both items taken care
of at the same time.

MR. PERLITER -	My work is as good as anything, without signing. I

will give you an answer tomorrow and will be here
to explain.

MAYOR BAKER -	Let the City Manager know.

MR. BUNKER -	Are you able to indemnify the City against any loss?

MR. PERLITER -	I do not know.

MR. BUNKER -	$5,000.00 settlement is fine.

Mr. L. E. Tyson, engineer for Assessment District No. 100-27, reported to
the Board on the low bidders for the installation of improvements in said
District. No action was taken at this time.

Thereafter, there being no further business to come before the Board at
this special meeting, the meeting adjourned.
