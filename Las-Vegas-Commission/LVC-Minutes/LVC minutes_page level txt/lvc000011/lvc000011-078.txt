BUDGET FOR 1958-1959 	Mayor Baker announced that this was the time set for the public hearing on the 
	proposed Budget of the City of Las Vegas for the fiscal year of 1958-1959.

At this time City Manager Kennedy presented the proposed Budget and a letter 
transmitting the same to the Board of Commissioners; which is as follows:

March 5, 1958

The Honorable Mayor and Board of City Commissioners;

City of Las Vegas;

Las Vegas; Nevada.

Gentlemen:

The Budget for 1958/59 consists of a total amount of $4,887,517.19. This represents 
the total Revenue plus balance carried forward of the City of Las Vegas as
estimated for 1958/59 and the expenses as estimated for 1958/59 amount to the
identical figure of $4,887,517.19. Of this amount; $710,095.07 is for the payment 
of Bonds; Interest and Reserve that are required. This is equal to 34₵  on
the Tax Rate. The largest portion of the balance is for Operating Expenses.

Within the Operating Expenses is $2,677,528.42 that represents salaries paid by
the City of Las Vegas to its employees, representing 535 full time employees and
36 part time employees. The authorized positions of the 1958/59 Budget are 39
less positions than 1957/58. The balance of the money in the Operating Fund for
Operating Expenses is $819,444.14. For Capital Outlay the amount of $680,449.56
represents the expenses that the City will incur for capital projects in all Departments.

Within the Total Budget there is a sale of capital, assets which would be the sale
of land in the amount of $250,000. This is also represented in an expense in
Park and Recreation; with $100,000.00 each; $50,000 to be held if some of the
land is purchased by the State as down payment on the State building; if it is
determined that the City will buy the StateBuilding. Therefore; this amount
should be reduced from the totals of both Revenue and Operation. Therefore;
this amount is a contingent amount on the sale of land; which will be spent only
if the land is sold within the year 1958/59. Therefore; this amount shows both
in Revenue and Expenses as Off-setting Accounts. With this offset on both sides;
Revenue and Expenditures; the actual Budget figures with this reduction leaves a
total of $3,927,422.12 on both sides of the ledger.

The monies representing the Revenue are obtained from sources and in the amounts
as indicated on the Revenue Schedule attached. (See page 2).

The expenses for the Operation of the City is basically in three categories:

1.	Bond Payments:

Principle	$237,000.00

Interest	173,498.00

Reserve Funds Required	299,597.07

TOTAL BOND PAYMENT -	$	710,095.07

2.	Departmental Operating Expense	3,496,972.56

3.	Departmental Capital Outlay	680,449.56

Operating expenses and Capital Outlay by Departments are as indicated on the
Schedule of Departmental Operating Expense attached; (See page 4.). (The 
breakdown by Departments is carried in the copy of the proposed Budget Books; of
which the Mayor and Commissioners each have a copy.

In comparing the 1957/58 Budget and the 1958/59 Budget estimates, it shows that
the estimated available funds are $436,387.13 less than the estimate for 1957/58.

The beginning Fund Balance as shown forwarded this year will be $50,353.67; as in
comparison to the beginning Fund Balance of $344,699.88 in the 1957/58 Budget.
Accounting for this is the reduction of actual funds coming to the City in the
different Revenue accounts than the amount projected in the 1957/58 Budget. The
expenses in 1957/58 were reduced tp compensate for the reduction in Revenue to
the amount that would leave a Balance Forwarded this year of $50,353.67. From
the time of last year's Budget preparation to June 30, 1958 it appears that the
General Fund Revenue will fall short of the estimated by $167,629.19. This shortage
will be more than offset by the reduction in expenditures amounting to $217,982.86,
leaving an estimated Fund Balance Forwarded at the year ending 1957/58 Budget of

$50,353.67.
