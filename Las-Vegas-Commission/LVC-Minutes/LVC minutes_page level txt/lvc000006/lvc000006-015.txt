Re:	Zone Exception Case No. 23

Mrs. Florence B. Nelms

Gentlemen:

In accordance with your action and request of December 7, 1946, this is to
advise you regarding the above mentioned Zone Exception case.

At a meeting of the Joint Planning Commission held January 20, 1947, with
Mrs. Nelms present, this matter was again reconsidered for recommendation. However,
the Commission has taken the case under advisement and is studying every detail with
respect to the City land use and zoning plan. It was ordered that this matter and
the studies thereto be completed hurriedly and that Mrs. Nelms be rendered definite
decision within thirty days.

Respectfully,

LAS VEGAS -- CLARK COUNTY

STREETS & HIGHWAYS Commissioner Bates moved that the following recommendation of the
R/W Acquisition	Planning Commission dated January 21, 1947 be approved:

Gibson & Jones Tract

Honorable Mayor and Board of City Commissioners

Re:	STREETS & HIGHWAYS

R/W Acquisition
Gibson & Jones Tract

Gentlemen:

The matter of acquiring right-of-way for street purposes adjoining the south
boundary of the Gibson & Jones Tract was considered at a meeting of the Joint Planning
Commission held January 20, 1947.

It is recommended that the acceptance of this right-of-way be approved in order
to establish a street to serve Lots 13 to 24, inclusive, Block 2 of the Gibson & Jones
Addition. At this time, if possible, it is recommended that sufficient acquisition be
made at the easterly portion of this dedicated strip to make possible a full connection
with 23rd Street. The establishment of this right-of-way will then become a portion of
Ogden Avenue as the same will ultimately be created by extension easterly from Bruce Street
or 18th Street.

Respectfully,

LAS VEGAS -- CLARK COUNTY
