Mr. T. E. Fennessy
City Manager
Las Vegas, Nevada

Subject:	 Purchase of New 160 Megacycles Radio Equipment for the City

Police Department

Dear Mr. Fennessy:

Due to the changes in radio equipment since the war, the Federal Communications
Commission has issued an order requiring City Police Departments to shift their radio
equipment from their present frequencies to 160 Megacycles. This order is to become 

effective January 1, 1948. As it is necessary for this department to buy certain new 

equipment for its present operation, I would like to recommend that we make the change now rather
than wait fourteen months for reasons set forth below;

The total cost of this equipment will be $6500.00

1. By purchasing the equipment now, the Clark County Sheriff's Office will
buy our present equipment at $200.00 per unit affecting a saving of 

approximately $1800.00. The new equipment necessary to operate on our
present frequencies and already on order values at approximately $1000.00 and
is covered by the 1946, Budget. It will also be necessary to purchase a new
Main Station Transmitter which has been ordered for January 1, 1947 payment
and delivery at a cost of $700.00. This would make a total of approximately
$3000.00 cash credits and funds to be expended. If the purchase is made a year
hence, we cannot realize this saving as there will be no market for the equipment.
