parcel of land with such relative portion of the whole amount to be levied as the length of front of such pre-
mises abutting upon the improvement bears to the whole frontage of all the lots to be assessed; unless on ac-
count of the shape or size of any lot or lots an assessment for a different number of feet would be more equit-
able; and the frontage of all lots to be assessed shall be. deemed to be the aggregate number of feet as deter-
mined upon for assessment by the assessor.

all such assessments, or any part thereof, may, at the election of the owner, be paid in installments with in-
