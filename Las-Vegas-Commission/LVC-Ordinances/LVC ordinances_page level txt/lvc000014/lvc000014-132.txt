wasting into the sewers without being put to a full beneficial use; and

of health, comfort, safety, life welfare and property of the inhabitants of said City to
regulate the use of water therein and to prevent the waste thereof, NOW, THEREFORE,

Section 1. Waste of water in the City of Las Vegas is hereby prohibited and declared un-

any public utility, to leak onto the ground or into any sink, bowl, toilet or tub connected
with a sewer or cesspool, or permitting water to drain from a person's premises	any

street, alley, or road, after the person permitting the same has been notified to remedy
such leak or to prevent such draining by any public officer, or an agent of any public
utility, as hereinafter defined ;

(b)	Using water from any water system belonging to any public utility for the purpose of
