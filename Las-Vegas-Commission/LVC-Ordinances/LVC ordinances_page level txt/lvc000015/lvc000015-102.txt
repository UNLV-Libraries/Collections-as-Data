tion at the termination of each trip. The said taximeters shall be subject to inspection from time to time
by the Police Department. Any inspector or other officer of said department is hereby authorized either
on complaint of any person or without such complaint, to inspect any meter and, upon discovery of any in-
accuracy therein, to notify the person operating said taxicab to cease operation. Thereupon said taxicab
shall be kept off the streets until the taximeter is repaired and in the required working condition.
