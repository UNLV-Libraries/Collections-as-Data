to he removed on 30 days' notice at any time the City desired the

Deputy City Attorney Whitmore advised the Commission could grant this
request, stating an agreement should he entered into between the
City and Vern Willis, providing for retention of title to the right-
of-way in the City, and that such agreement should be recorded.

Ordinance for adoption at the next regular meeting of the Board of
City Commissioners.

Deputy City Attorney Whitmore informed the Commission a proposed
Ordinance had been drafted and read the same by title as follows:

AND ORDINANCE TO PERMIT CERTAIN DISABLED PERSONS TO PARK WITHIN THE
CITY IN RESTRICTED PARKING ZONES; PRESCRIBING REGULATION S THEREFOR;
PROVIDING FOR PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION THEREOF; AND REPEALING ALL
ORDINANCES OR PARTS THEREOF IN CONFLICT HEREWITH.

The next matter to come before the Commission was the sale of
effluent water by the City. A lengthy discussion followed between
the Board of City Commissioners, Consulting Engineer Carollo, Mr.

Lalif Wood, City Manager Kennedy, Deputy Director of Public Works
V. B. Uehling, Superintendent of Sanitation Lou Anton and Mr. Jack
Wallenzein, and it was decided that a meeting be held between the
proposed purchasers of the effluent water and the City Attorney for
the purpose of reaching an agreement as to the sale of the effluent
water and the erection of necessary installations.

Mr. Don Bacca stated he would like to open a Men's Shop at the
Showboat Hotel and, for this purpose, would like to convert two
bedrooms into a shop. It was brought out that this proposed conversion
would reduce the number of rooms to $8 and would disqualify the
Showboat Hotel to hold a Casino license.
