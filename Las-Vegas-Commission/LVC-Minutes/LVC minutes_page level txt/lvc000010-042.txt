SHIRLEY BALLINGER
City Clerk

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Absent:	Commissioner Sharp.

Action on the disposition of the Wildcat Lair Building was held in abeyance until
a full Board is present.

Commissioners Bunker and Sharp were appointed as a committee to investigate the pro-
posal of V. D. Eachus and E. L. Josephson to trade a portion of the SE¼ of the SE¼
of Section 21, T20S, R6lE, MDB&M for a portion of the City's property located in the
SW¼ of the SW¼ of Section 1, T21S, R6lE, MDB&M.

Commissioner Fountain moved that since it is a policy of the Commission on liquor
and gaming licenses that any change of ownership, management or operation be re-
ported to the City, and it appears that the Moulin Rouge Hotel not having kept
the License Department fully advised, that they be given notice to appear before
the Commission at the next meeting to show cause why their licenses should not be
revoked for failure to supply the City with detailed information on changes of
ownership, management and operation as requested by the Chief of Police.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Absent:	Commissioner Sharp.
