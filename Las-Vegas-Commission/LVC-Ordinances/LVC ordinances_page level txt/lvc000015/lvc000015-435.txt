EMERGENCY ORDINANCE NO. 687

AN EMERGENCY ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 24, SECTION 26, CODE OF LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, 1949, BY PER-
MITTING ADVERTISING SIGNS AND OTHER TEMPORARY STRUCTURES TO BE CONSTRUCTED AND MAINTAINED WITHIN
THE BUILDING SETBACK DISTANCE UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS; PROVIDING OTHER MATTERS PROPERLY RELATED
THERETO; AND REPEALING ALL ORDINANCES OR PARTS OF ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH.

WHEREAS, there are many advertising signs being improperly maintained at the present time
and under present ordinances because they are in the building setback lines; and

WHEREAS, the maintenance and erection of advertising signs and other temporary structures
within the building setback distance, so long as properly controlled, will be in the public interest
and not contrary to the public health, safety or morals,

NOW, THEREFORE, the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas do ordain as follows:

SECTION 1. Chapter 24, Section 26, Code of Las Vegas, Nevada, 1949, Paragraph A, Page
417 is hereby amended to read as follows:

A. For the purpose of measuring yard dimensions and determining building locations
with respect to future widthlines as provided in this article, the following
minimum building line setbacks and future width lines are hereby established
for the following streets and highways, such establishment being made pending
the establishment of official plan lines based upon the street and highway plan,
or sections thereof, of the master plan of the City.

No building or structure nor portion thereof shall hereafter be erected, nor
shall any portion of a building extending into the building setback distance
be altered, nor shall any use of land be conducted except the use of land
for agricultural purposes or any other open use not requiring a building or
structure, so that the same will be closer to the right of way line of any
street than any official plan line or any building line or setback which has
been established for such street by the street and highway plan, or section
thereof, of the master plan of the city, or than any future width line,
building line or setback, which may be specified thereof by the zoning ordi-
nance; provided however that advertising signs or other non-permanent structures
may be erected, and maintained within the setback distances upon the securing
of a permit from the building department, and upon the further condition that
the owner of the land shall sign a written agreement with the city that said
advertising sign or other structure will be removed without cost to the city
after fifteen (15) days written notice in the event that the street is to be
widened or other proper municipal use is to be made of the land by the City
or State.

SECTION 2. This ordinance is not intended to amend Chapter 24, Section 26, as amended
by Ordinance Nos. 673,618, and 659 except insofar as such ordinances are in conflict herewith.
