We should be able to complete our studies on this within the next ten to fifteen days
so that we may correct anything that is not of an effect that it is going to cost additional
funds and advise them or our stand on some of these and ask for a recheck or a new grading
on the points that have been corrected. Our biggest deficiencies show Water System, many
of these which we will have to work out with the Water District. City Manager stated the
City was 219 points from a Class 3 and it is his belief that we can reduce a number of these
points and that he has talked with the Main Office of the City Manager Association and they
will go along with us.
