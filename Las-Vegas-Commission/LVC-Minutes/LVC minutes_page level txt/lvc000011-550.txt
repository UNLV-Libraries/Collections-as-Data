PROPOSED ORDINANCE	An Ordinance entitled:	AN	ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION IV OF ORDINANCE NO. 378,

Rezoning (2-13-59)	REFERRED TO AS SECTION 10,	CHAPTER 24, CODE OF LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, 1949, BY AMENDING

THE LAND USE PLAN MAP ADOPTED BY THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS, AND CHANGING THE ZONING
Referred to Committee DESIGNATION OF CERTAIN AREAS OF THE SAID MAP, was read by title and referred to

Commissioners Fountain and Whipple, committee for recommendation.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE	At this time consideration was given the proposed Motel Ordinance which was 

Motel Ordinance	introduced and read by title at	the regular meeting of the Board of City Commissioners

held August 5, 1959, and referred to Commissioners Fountain and Whipple, committee
Continued	for recommendation.

Mr. Leigh Ellsworth of the Motel Association addressed the Commission stating there
was a question whether or not anything should be done in this regard until the
Supreme Court made a decision regarding the constitutionality of the State Law or

should be given this group and were gratified at the harmony which presently exists
in the industry; however, Commissioner Whipple asked City Attorney, Calvin Cory, for
a statement in this regard.

City Attorney Cory advised that he had not discussed this proposed ordinance with
Mr. Ellsworth, but that he had talked with Mr. Empey, Mr. Barringer, and the District
Attorney. He continued that because he was so much in support of what they were
trying to accomplish, he felt it was unwise for the Motel Organization to wish the
adoption of this ordinance until the Supreme Court decided the constitutionality of
the State Law; and furthermore, the adoption of such an ordinance might prejudice
the argument of the case in the Supreme Court. He added that Attorney Posen, who
represents eleven motel owners, would be able to take advantage in the Supreme
