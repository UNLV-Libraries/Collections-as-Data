PACKAGE LIQUOR 	The Commission again considered the application of Joseph Julian for a package liquor license at

APPLICATION	the Joe Julian Liquor Store, 2400 South 5th Street. This application was held in abeyance at the

Joe Julian Liquor Store               last meeting of the Board of City Commissioners held April 15, 1959.

Held in Abeyance	Planning Director Bills stated that in regard to the definition of a "Shopping Center" he did not

know of any immediately available authorization for saying something is, or is not, a "Shopping
Center" as such. He added that he would not consider this area a shopping center and would want
to research it further before making a concrete statement to that effect.

Commissioner Sharp referred to a resolution of some years ago that would allow shopping centers
in outlying areas that serve large residential areas to be issued package liquor licenses.

These centers to serve an area of approximately a mile radius and enable them to do their
shopping without going down town. Commissioner Whipple also referred to such a resolution
and stated he believed this application might come under this resolution.

City Attorney Cory asked approximately when this resolution was adopted and Commissioner Sharp
stated that he believed it was in year 1953 or 1954. The Supervisor of License and Revenue, Jean
Dutton, stated that he had researched the City Commission Minutes from 1954 to 1959 and could
not find where this resolution had been adopted.

His Honor Mayor Baker asked if anyone present interested in this application would like to speak.

Myer Cohen addressed the Board stating that he was building the San Francisco Square Shopping
Center and presented the plan to the Commission. He stated it will cover 35,000 sq. ft.; that
there would be 21 stores and a supermarket with 72,000 sq. ft. of parking area. He added that
there is a need for a shopping center in the area consisting of some 5,500 people living there
and San Francisco Square would be very convenient for them to buy most anything they might need
and that they should be able to buy their liquor there. He stated further that there is a 15'
sidewalk and that the Planning Commission is going to allow a 5' sidewalk and that thereby
additional parking could be provided.
