EULOGY -- Claud C. On motion of Commissioner Baskin duly seconded by Commissioner
Sargent Moore and carried by unanimous vote the following eulogy was
ordered spread on the Minutes:

The members of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas deeply
regret the passing of Claud C. Sargent. His untimely demise has deprived this city
of a sincere friend and a devoted public servant. Since making this his home in
1929, he established an enviable record for loyalty and integrity in the affairs
of business and municipal government. By his human qualities of kindness, toler-
ance and understanding, he found everlasting endearment in the hearts of those who
knew him, and earned an exalted place in life. His passing will be keenly felt by
us in municipal government who were benefitted by daily association with him, as
well as by the host of friends he left behind. We extend our deepest sympathy to
his family whose loss is irreparable. They may well take consolation in the know-
ledge that their husband and father was loved by all, and that no other can fill
the place he found in the hearts of his friends.
