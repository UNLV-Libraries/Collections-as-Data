SET-BACK REQUIREMENTS	Request of Mr. Robert Brooks to amend Ordinance No. 659 Master Plan of Streets and

South 2nd between	Highways so that South 2nd between Wyoming and Oakey Blvd. is not designated as a

Wyoming and Oakey	major street and set-back of 40' from center line of the right-of-way would no

Robert Brooks	longer be required.

Approved	At the Commission meeting of December 3, 1958, this request was referred to the

Planning Commission. At the Commission meeting held December 17, 1958, the Planning
Commission recommended that no change be made in ordinance no. 659 and as an
alternative recommended the vacation or abandonment of South 2nd Street; from
Wyoming to Oakey and to improve Wyoming to make a workable traffic movement from
South 2nd through Wyoming on to South 5th Street. At this City Commission meeting
motion was made to hold this matter in abeyance. The Planning Commission 
recommendation still stands as heretofore stated.

Planning Director Bills advised the Board that 2nd Street from Bonanza to Oakey as
a secondary street requires a 40' setback from the center line and that is the way
it is all the way to Wyoming; however; there is only a 32½' setback between Wyoming
and Oakey due to a vacation in 1948. The Traffic Department states that there is
a bad situation at Oakey and Wyoming in that there is such a short distance between
there and South 5th. He further stated that one Motel owner feels that it would be
bad for his business if this portion of South 2nd was vacated.

Attorney Louis Wiener; Jr.; spoke for his client; Mr. Brooks; stating that Mr.

Brooks has no objection to the vacating of the street and he would still build
7%-' from the present curb line; however; he is desirous of one plan or the other
being approved by the City Commission; and it appeared to Mr. Wiener that one or
the other of the moves would be favorable.

Mr. Bridgman spoke to the Commission stating that he owned the property where the
Jackpot Motel is located at South 2nd and Wyoming and that his $8,000.00 worth of
neon signs now show over to 5th St. He objected to the vacationing of the street
as he felt it would greatly reduce his business.

Attorney Wiener stated that he did not see how South 2nd Street could be a through
street as it couldn't go through Market Town. Mr. Christensen spoke from the
audience stating that he uses 2nd Street a lot and has seen traffic almost as
heavy as that on 5th Street. It was his opinion that a great deal of traffic turns
off 5th Street on Oakey and then turns down 2nd Street.

Commissioner Bunker stated that he would be opposed to vacating this portion of
the street and would be in favor of changing the setback and allowing the 7½" sidewalk.
Commissioner Whipple agreed with Commissioner Bunker and said that he would approve
allowing them to build up to 7½" from the curb. Commissioner Bunker was of the
opinion that the builder was certainly entitled to an answer and felt the Commission
should act upon this matter at this meeting.

Commissioner Bunker moved that the request of Mr. Robert Brooks to amend Ordinance
No. 659 Master Plan of Streets and Highways so that South 2nd Street between Wyoming
Avenue and Oakey Boulevard is not designated as a major street and reduce the set-
back of 40' from the center line of the right-of-way to 32½', be approved; and the
City Attorney be instructed to prepare the amending ordinance.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Bunker; Sharp; Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes; none. Absent:	Commissioner

Fountain.
