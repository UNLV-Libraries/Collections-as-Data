The Board of	Commissioners	of the City	of	Las Vegas do ordain as follows:

Section 1.	Section XIV.,	Article IV,	of	Ordinance No. 170 of the City of	Las Vegas

is hereby amended to read as follows:

SECTION XIV. TURNING: - It shall be unlawful for the driver of any vehicle to violate
or fail to comply with any of the provisions hereinafter in this section set forth.

(1)	In turning to the left at street intersections, vehicles shall keep to the left of

the intersection markers or buttons set in the center of said intersections, and in the event
there are no markers or buttons set in the center of said intersections, then such vehicles
shall keep to the	left of the center of said intersection, but no vehicle shall	commence

to make such left	turn until it	has arrived	at	such street intersection, and it	shall keep as

close to said intersection markers or button or center of said intersection as practicable.

(2)	No vehicle shall be turned to the left at any street intersection or into any
alley or driveway, unless said vehicle is at the time, in the line of vehicles nearest the
center of the roadway.

(3)	Between the hours of seven A. M. and Seven P. M., of any day no vehicle shall be
turned to the left into or out of any alley or driveway in the Central Traffic District or
in any business district or upon any intersection where the Street Superintendent shall
have posted on the approaching side of the roadway a proper signal so directing.

(4) Right hand turns may be made at any intersection at any time provided, however,
that the operator of vehicles shall not turn such vehicle to the right at any intersection

or into any alley or driveway unless such vehicle is at the time of turning, in the line
of traffic nearest the curb to the right of such vehicle; provided, however, that if the
traffic signal, or traffic sign, is against the person making such right hand turn, the driver
of such vehicle shall come to a complete stop before turning right.

(5) The Street Superintendent is hereby authorized to mark intersections in the
following manner; a single marker shall be placed at the intersection of the medial lines
of intersecting streets when said streets intersect at right angles, except those inter-
sections which in the opinion of the Street Superintendent shall be marked by placing a marker
on each of the intersecting streets at the intersection of the medial lines of the roadway
and a prolongation of the property lines of the intersecting streets. For streets which do
not intersect at right angles or which can not be marked in either manner above specified
in the opinion of the Street Superintendent, he shall mark the same by placing a marker in
each of the intersecting streets at the points which in his opinion shall be most practicable
and safe to the traveling public.
