Hodgens, Martin and Ireland we appointed to a committee for the purpose of investigating conditions

in Odd Town, and directed to report at the next regular meeting.

Upon motion of Commissioner Brickie, seconded by Commissioner Ireland, the following Preambles
and Resolution were duly adopted:

WHEREAS the City of Las Vegas was duly constituted as a municipal corporation within the
County of Clark, State of Nevada under and by virtue of the provisions of Chapter 132 of the
Session Laws of 1911, by an Act approved March 16, 1911, and

WHEREAS, Las Vegas Land & Water Company is a corporation duly incorporated under the laws
of the State of Nevada, with its principal office and place of business in the City of Las Vegas
County of Clark, State of Nevada, and

WHEREAS the said Las Vegas Land & Water Company is now and for many years prior to the
passage of this Resolution has been, engaged in the business, among other things, of supplying water
for domestic, commercial and fire protection purposes within the City of Las Vegas under and by vir-
tue of a franchise issued to said Company by the Board of County Commissioners of Clark County,
Nevada prior to the incorporation of the said City of Las Vegas, and

WHEREAS the pressure of the water so furnished to the City of Las Vegas for fire protec-
tion purposes is wholly inadequate to furnish sufficient or any protection against fires occurring
within said Las Vegas Townsite, which is included within the boundaries of said City of Las Vegas
in this:

(1)	That the average pressure of water delivered for fire protection purposes does not ex-
ceed a pressure of 20 lbs. at any of the fire hydrants, and much of the time there is a lesser pres-
sure.

(2) That the main conducting the water from the source of supply to the Townsite of Las
Vegas is, and has remained for a long period of time in a bad state of repair, permitting numerous
and large leakages, and a consequent diminution of the pressure which otherwise would be had were
such main pat and kept in a state of good repair.

(3) That the said Las Vegas Land & Water Company does not and for a long period of time has
not allowed sufficient water to enter the service pipes within the limits of said Townsite of Las
Vegas to maintain a pressure over said average of 20 lbs., but has arbitrarily cat off from the main,
leading from the source of supply, to the said service pipes by means of valves and other wise, a
large volume of water which otherwise would flow into the service pipes within said Townsite of Las

Vegas and would increase the water pressure for fire, domestic and commercial purposes.

(4)	That the service pipes within said Townsite of Las Vegas are in a bad state of repair
and will not permit of a water pressure sufficient for adequate fire protection, and have been in 
such bad state of repair far many years, and

WHEREAS the pressure of the water so furnished to consumers within said Townsite of Las Vegas
is wholly inadequate for the conduct of water daring the summer months to the second or other stories
of buildings above the first story, for domestic, commercial or fire protection purposes for the
reasons set forth in the last proceeding preamble,

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Complaint be made by this Board on behalf of said City
of Las Vegas to the Public Service Commission of the State of Nevada of the conditions existing

with reference to the water service within said City of Las Vegas as here in above in the Preambles
set forth with the request that investigation and action thereon be had by said Public Service
Commission to remedy such conditions, which are hereby declared to be a menace to the safety, health
comfort and convenience of the residents of the City of Las Vegas ,and a menace to the property
situate within said City; that an emergency exists by reasons thereof which calls for immediate
and effective action.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a certified copy of the foregoing Preambles and Resolution be
forwarded by the Clerk of this Board to said Public Service Commission, and that the same be con-
sidered a formal complaint, subject to amendment, modification, or to be supplemented, as said Public

Service Commission may require.
