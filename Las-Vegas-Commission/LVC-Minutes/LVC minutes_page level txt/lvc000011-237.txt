Mayor Pro Tem Whipple suggested the people put this type of trash in proper containers and
bundles and let the disposal company pick them up.

DAMAGE TO STREETS	City Manager Kennedy reported to the Board that he has received letters from the Las Vegas

Courthouse	Builders' Exchange, Associated General Contractors of America and Laing-Garrett Construction

Construction	Specialties protesting the possibility of the City making any demand on them for damage to

pavement resulting from normal and necessary service to the Courthouse construction project.

In the discussion that followed it was agreed that some of the large equipment is breaking
down the paving. The City has already fixed one area. If an assessment district was put in,
the demand on the property owners would be too great.

Any weight over 5,000 lbs. is forbidden on the streets except on truck routes. Another
suggestion presented was that perhaps our truck licenses should be revised or else raise the
weight restriction up a little bit.

The fact remains that there exists a real problem and one that will probably increase with
big building projects coming up in the future.

Mr. Kennedy said that when he returns from out of town next week that he will contact these
companies concerned as there is a lot of misunderstanding on both sides.

There being no further business to come before the Board, at the hour of 9:15 P.M. Commissioner
Sharp moved this meeting adjourn.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Sharp and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem voting aye; noes, none. Absent:	Mayor C. D.

Baker and Commissioner Fountain.
