ORDINANCE NUMBER 291

AN ORDINANCE TO PROVIDE FOR CONSTRUCTION OF NEW SIDEWALKS, REPAIR OF SIDEWALKS IN DISREPAIR,
ASSESSMENT AGAINST PROPERTY OWNERS FAILING TO INSTALL NEW SIDEWALKS, OR REPAIR SIDEWALKS
IN DISREPAIR, AND PROVIDE FOR FILING AND RECORDING OF BEN AGAINST REAL PROPERTY AND FORE-
CLOSURE OF THE SAME FOR EXPENDITURES IN REPAIR, OR CONSTRUCTION OF SIDEWALK WHEN THE SAME
IS PERFORMED BY THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS.

The Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas do ordain as follows:

Section 1: When any portion of sidewalk within the City Limits of the City of Las
Vegas shall be found in need or repair, the City Manager shall at once report the nec-
essity for repair to the property owner whose property the sidewalk abuts or adjoins.

Section 2: Wherever sidewalks have not been installed in the City of Las Vegas at
locations where such sidewalks are considered to be necessary for the public benefit, the
City Manager shall at once report to the property owner whose property abuts or adjoins
said locations the necessity for installing sidewalk thereon.

Section 3: Whenever repairs to sidewalks, or new sidewalks are found to be necessary,
and such necessity is reported to the property owner by the City Manager, and such pro-
perty owner, within a period of thirty (30) days after such notice, refuses or fails to
make such repairs or installations, it shall be the duty of the City Manager to report
such refusal or failure on the part of the property owner to the Board of Commissioners.

If the Board of Commissioners then decide that repairs to old, or installations of new,
sidewalks shall be made by the City of Las Vegas, and the expense thereof charged against
said abutting or adjoining property, the City Engineer shall be instructed to proceed
with such work. When the expense of such work performed by the City of Las Vegas shall
have been determined, the Board of Commissioners shall at once file a lien against the
property abutting or adjoining upon the said sidewalk. Said lien shall be levied by the
City Treasurer who shall give notice thereof and at once proceed to collect the same in
like manner as other liens are collected, except that notice of such lien shall specify
that it is to cover the expense of repairs on a certain sidewalk, or the cost of install-
ation of a new sidewalk abutting or adjoining certain real property, and that the expen-
diture is both due and delinquent, and shall fix a time not more than thirty (30) days
from the date thereof when said lien shall be enforced as other liens are enforced by
laws.

Section 4: All sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with the plans and
specifications of the City Engineer's Office, which work shall be inspected and approved
