At this time Attorneys David Zenoff, Calvin Cory and John Sullivan appeared on behalf of
their clients, Market Town, Fremont Drug and Thriftimart, respectively and requested the
Commission's re-consideration of the portion of the Liquor Ordinance that prohibits the
sale of half-pints and miniatures by package liquor licenses in drugstores, shopping centers
and grocery stores.

Mr. Zenoff pointed out that Market Town had been permitted to sell less than one-pint prior
to July 1st of this year and at the present time had stock on hand that could not be re-
turned to the wholesale liquor distributors.

Thereafter Commissioner Fountain moved that a new ordinance be redrawn to effect an amend-
ment to allow all package liquor stores to sell half-pints.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Bunker, Fountain voting aye; noes, none. Absent: Commissioner Sharp. Commissioner 
Whipple and Mayor Baker passed their vote.

There being no further business to come before the Commission, Commissioner Bunker moved
this meeting adjourn.
