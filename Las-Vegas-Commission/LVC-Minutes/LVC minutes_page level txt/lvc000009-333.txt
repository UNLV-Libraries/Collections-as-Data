CITY MANAGERS'
CONFERENCE

ASSESSMENT DISTRICT
100-25

Mr. Rounthwaite stated that very fine relations with the telephone company have been
established with regard to house moving and in return they have agreed to go ahead
with the City on planning a conduit fire-alarm system. This system would cost the City
$10,000 to place said conduit which would be on Fremont Street from Main to 5th and
Carson Street from Main to 14th. The money is available in the Capital Outlay Budget
of 1955. By working with the Telephone Company at this time the City will save approx-
imately $40,000 as ditches will be supplied by the Company.

Commissioner Sharp moved that the tentative bids be filed and approval given this
matter.

Seconded by Commissioner Jarrett and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

The City Manager recommended that the bid on the blow sand for Sunrise Acre Park be
awarded to Howard Geer at 95 cents a cubic foot. The total area to be sanded is 1500
cubic feet and the cost will be $1,425. This blow sand is to be free of foreign matter
and available for delivery upon request.

Commissioner Bunker moved that this request be approved.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Bunker, Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

The City Manager stated that the Cemetery Agreement with the Las Vegas Jewish Community
Center is being worked on by the City Attorney's office.

Mr. Rounthwaite stated that a City Managers' Conference will be held in St. Petersburg,
Florida, from December 5 to 8, 1954.

The Board was informed that Howard Cannon, City Attorney, will be in Reno this weekend
and can go to Carson City and negotiate with the State Highway Department concerning
Assessment District 100-25 if the Board deems it advisable.

The question was raised with regard to the bid of Nevada Electric on Assessment District
100-25 as to whether or not the City should authorize the purchase of light poles.

The Board decided that Mr. Cannon should speak to the State Highway Department and
this matter be held in abeyance until such time as Mr. Cannon returns.

There being no further business to come before the Board at this time, the meeting
adjourned.
