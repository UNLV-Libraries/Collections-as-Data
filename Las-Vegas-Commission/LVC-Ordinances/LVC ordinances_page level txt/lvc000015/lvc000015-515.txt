schedule of revenue per gaming unit has been determined, and a business license or percentage or
surcharge on the amount of room rentals collected on hotel and motel rooms, which revenue, if
collected from all individuals, partnerships, corporations and joint ventures in the trades or
businesses described as "Operators", would be sufficient for maintenance and operation and pro-

sorting to ad valorem taxation; and
