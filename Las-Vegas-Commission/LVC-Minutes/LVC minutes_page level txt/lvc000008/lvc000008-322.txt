the officers and inhabitants thereof, desire to enlarge and increase the capacity
of its municipal sewerage system; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of said City has determined, and does here-
by determine that it is necessary and for the best interest of the City of Las Veg-
as and the inhabitants thereof that the municipal sewerage system of the City of
Las Vegas be enlarged and modernized by the construction of additional trunk lines
and interceptors and that a part of the cost thereof be defrayed by the issuance
of General Obligation Sewer Bonds of the City of Las Vegas in the amount of $900,000
or so much thereof as may be necessary; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has determined, and does hereby determine,
that it is necessary and advisable to submit the question of issuing said bonds to

provided by the statutes of the State of Nevada and the Charter of the City of Las
Vegas, as amended,

NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE CITY OF
LAS VEGAS AS FOLLOWS:

Section 1. That the City of Las Vegas acquire, construct, and establish at an
estimated initial cost of $900,000.00 additional sanitary sewer trunk lines and inter-
ceptors to the existing municipal sewerage system for serving and supplying with

Section 2. That the City proposes to incur a bonded indebtedness (subject to
the approval of the regularly qualified electors of the City) to defray, in part,
the cost of so acquiring, constructing, and erecting additional sanitary sewer trunk
lines and interceptors to the existing municipal sewerage system by the issuance of
its negotiable coupon General Obligation Sewer Bonds in the aggregate principal
amount of $900,000.00, or so much thereof as may be necessary, said bonds to be pay-
able from an annual tax levy on all the taxable property in the City, sufficient in
amount (subject to the limitations imposed by the Constitution and Laws of the State
of Nevada) to meet the annual and semi-annual payments of principal and interest,
and from such other sources, available therefor as the Board of Commissioners at its option
determine, said bonds to mature serially in regular numerical order at annual inter-
vals in substantially equal amounts of principal or substantially equal amounts of

terest payment date on or after 10 years from the date of said bonds, and shall as
nearly as practicable be issued for a period which shall be equivalent to the life
of such improvements which is hereby determined to be at least twenty-five years
from the date of said bonds, Said Bonds (if their issuance is approved by the regu-
larly qualified electors) shall be sold publicly in accordance with the Statutes of
