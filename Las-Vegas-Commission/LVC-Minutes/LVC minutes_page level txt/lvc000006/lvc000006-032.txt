 Bonanza Road	Manager of the Nevada Biltmore Hotel:

Las Vegas, Nevada
March 7, 1947

City of Las Vegas,

Las Vegas, Nevada

Attention:	Mr. Rittenhouse

Dear Hr. Rittenhouse

I am authorized by Mr. Jules LeBaron, President of the Biltmore Hotel Corporation, who

happens to be in the city at the present time and is willing to sign papers immediately	

that this is completed so that State and City can proceed with the construction of Bonanza

Road through to Fifth Street.

I am authorized to submit the proposal that I will arrange for the execution of deeds and

other related documents covering the conveyance of right of way to the City of Las Vegas

for the reconstruction and widening of North Main Street and Bonanza Road, as proposed by

the State Highway Department, under the following conditions:	

1.	Execution of deeds and related documents conveying to the City
of Las Vegas, the right of way as described in proposed deeds
originally submitted to Mr. Horace Heidt, former owner of the
Nevada Biltmore Hotel property, being an area of about 350 square
feet at the south west corner of Block "A" of the Biltmore Addi-
tion, also an area of about 113 square feet along the southerly
boundary line of lot 11 Block 3 of the Biltmore addition.

2.	Upon delivery of the executed documents the City of Las Vegas will
pay for the described right of way $841.53, that amount being 50%

of the bid of the Superior Construction Company in its proposal of
February 28, 1947 for the work desired by the Nevada Biltmore Hotel
owners in removing walls from the right of way, relocating the hotel
entrance and constructing walls along the right of way lines.

Very truly yours

Jack Walsh
