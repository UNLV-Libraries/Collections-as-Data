property owners objected not only to the granting of a Use Permit for the construction
of a medical center, but they did not wish anything built in this neighborhood, which
is located at Weldon Place between St. Louis and El Centro Place, other than strictly
residential structures.

City Attorney Cannon explained that in an R-4 zone the Commission has the right to
grant a Use Permit for this type of construction if they determine use is necessary
for the public health, safety, convenience or welfare.

Dr. Sanner advised the Commission that it was their plan to construct the type of
building that would be adaptable to the neighborhood and would be landscaped to look
as well or better than any neighboring building.

Mayor Baker announced that it was 8:00 P.M., the time set for opening of bids, so the
application of Drs. Eklun and Sanner to construct a professional office building would
be continued after the bid openings.
