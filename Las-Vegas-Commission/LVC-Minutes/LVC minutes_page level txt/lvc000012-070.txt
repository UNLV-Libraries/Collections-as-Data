City Manager Kennedy presented the request of the Pioneer Club for
approval of a celebration of their Grand Opening in April, after
completion of remodeling.

Commissioner Sharp said, although the Resolution on Give-Aways had
never been adopted, he did not think every one of these requests
should come before the Commission, so long as the policy was
complied with.

City Attorney Cory advised Commissioner Sharp would be correct if
the Resolution had been adopted and was in effect, in order to give
the City Manager a standard by which to be guided; however, after
the last meeting on the Resolution, there were some modifications
and change of words, such as prohibiting drink tickets, and it was
his opinion the Resolution should be adopted to provide the City
Manager with a guide.

Commissioner Sharp moved the following Resolution be adopted:

RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, Section 31, of Chapter II, of the Charter of the
City of Las Vegas, authorizes and empowers the Board of Commissioners
of the City of Las Vegas to regulate, or prohibit and suppress games,
gaming houses, and gambling, as allowed by law, in all its various
forms; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas
finds that some liquor and gaming licensees have engaged in a
practice of giving away free gifts in various forms, and have
advertised the same to the general public; and said Board of
Commissioners further finds that the continuation of such "give-
away" practices without regulation is contrary to and detrimental
to the best interests and general welfare of the inhabitants of the
City of Las Vegas; and

WHEREAS, the said Board of Commissioners deems it desirable
and finds that it is expedient and necessary to adopt rules and
regulations governing the conduct and practices of gaming and
liquor licensees in the City of Las Vegas in advertising and giving
away free gifts, including annual or special celebrations or events,
and that such rules and regulations will be for the promotion and
protection of health, comfort, safety, welfare and property of the
inhabitants of the City of Las Vegas;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners
of the City of Las Vegas, at a Regular meeting thereof, held on the
3rd day of February, 1960, that the following rules and regulations
be and they hereby are adopted as rules and regulations governing the
conduct and method of operation of gaming and liquor licensees in
the City of Las Vegas:

1. No licensee, or agent or employee of any licensee, subject
to these rules and regulations, shall give away or distribute free
of charge to the general public any souvenir, free gift, advertising
material or other item of value in excess of the value of One Dollar
($1.00). All such souvenirs, free gifts, advertising material, or
items of value of $1.00 or less, shall be distributed only in the
place of business operated by such licensee in the City of Las Vegas,
or from the licensed premises of any other established place of
business, provided such distribution is made by the operator of such
business, or his agents or employees; or at the Clark County
