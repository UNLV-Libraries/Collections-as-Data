2. In the portion concerning the installation of water mains in the public
streets and alleys, the following is to be added:

The District shall notify said municipality prior to the opening and
restoring of the original condition of any public street or alley in such
municipal corporation.

Mr. C. Norman Cornwall was present and stated that the first amendment concerning
the Planning and Zoning ordinance was requested because the well field is located
in an R-1 zone and when new wells are needed the District would have to apply
for a variance. Also in the event the existing facilities needed repair or
replacement, it would not be permitted under the existing law since they are non-
conforming uses.

The Commission discussed this matter and determined that in the provision for the restoration
of the surface of streets and alleys there should be inserted the words "within a reasonable
length of time".

Thereafter Commissioner Sharp moved the changes to the Water District Act as recommended
by the City Attorney and Mr. C. Norman Cornwall, member of the Board of Directors of the
Las Vegas Valley Water District, be approved and the Legislature requested to pass Assembly
Bill No. 226 as amended.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:	Commissioners

Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent:	Commissioner

Bunker.

Mayor Baker asked if there were any protestants to or questions on the Budget of the City
of Las Vegas for 1957-1958. No protestants appeared.

Commissioner Whipple moved the Budget of the City of Las Vegas for the period of July 1,

1957 through June 30, 1958 be approved.
