Failure to pay the whole assessment, or any part thereof, within said period of ten days shall be 
conclusively considered and held an election on the part of all persons interested, whether under
disability or otherwise, to pay in such installments. In case of such election to pay in install-
ments, the unpaid assessments shall be payable at the office of said Ex-Officio City Treasurer
in ten substantially equal annual installments of principal, the first of which installments of
principal shall be due and payable on or before the 1st day of June, 1954} and the remainder of
said installments shall be due and payable successively on or before the same day in each year
thereafter until paid in full, with interest in all cases on the unpaid and deferred installments
of principal from the 1st day of June, 1953, at the same rate of interest as that provided for
in the special assessment bond to be hereafter authorized, sold, issued and delivered, but no
to exceed seven per centum (7%) per annum, payable annually at the office of said Ex-Officio City
Treasurer, the first annual payment of interest being due and payable on the said 1st day of June,
1954, and the remainder of said annual installments of interest being due and payable on the 1st
day of June in each year thereafter. Failure to pay any installments, whether of principal or
interest, when due, shall cause the whole of the unpaid principal to become due and payable im-
mediately, and the whole amount of the unpaid principal and accrued interest shall thereafter
bear penalty at the rate of ten per centum per annum, until the day of sale, but at any time
prior to the day of the sale, the owner may pay the amount of all unpaid installments, with inter-
est thereon at ten per centum per annum, and all penalties accrued, and shall thereupon be re-
stored to the right thereafter to pay in installments in the same manner as if default had not
been suffered. The owner of any property not in decault as to any installment or payment, may,
