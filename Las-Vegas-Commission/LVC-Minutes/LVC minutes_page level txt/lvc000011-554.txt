At this time, Herman Adams, Attorney for Mr. Sells, addressed the Commission stating
that his client was not notified of any of these conditions and that he had merely
been notified that Mrs. Ball had unintentionally made a misrepresentation. He added
there were similar operations in the area and if it was going to be rezoned to C-2
as Commissioner Sharp had suggested, he could not see what damage this would do.
Commissioner Sharp pointed out that he had made reference to this being considered
for C-2 zoning. Commissioner Whipple stated that it might be some time before such
a change might come about. Attorney Adams stated he would like to ask that this
matter be held in abeyance.
