SHOW CAUSE HEARING	His Honor Mayor Gragson announced this was the time set for the show cause hearing

Connie Mormon Child	of Connie Mormon in regard to her child nursery licenses.

Nursery Licenses

MR. CORY:	Your Honor and Commissioners, as you will recall at the regular meeting

of the Board of City Commissioners held July 1, 1959; a motion was
unanimously adopted that City Attorney prepare and serve a citation to Connie Mormon
to appear at this time to show cause why her licenses to operate child nurseries
should not be revoked. This action was taken upon the recommendation of a letter
received by the Commission from the Child Welfare Board recommending revocation of
her licenses on the grounds that the said Connie Mormon is an unfit person to be
trusted with the privileges granted by such license for the following reasons:

1.	Failure to properly isolate or remove one or more children from her nursery
upon discovering that said child, or children, had a contagious disease.

2.	Failure to comply with ordinances, rules and regulations of the City of Las
Vegas.

3.	Failure to cooperate with the Child Welfare Board in operation of her nurseries.

Pursuant to motion made on July 1, 1959; a notice to show cause was prepared,
delivered and served on July 2, 1959; a copy of the Child Welfare recommendations and
a copy of the notice to show cause has been furnished to each of the Commissioners.

In addition thereto, there have been furnished to the Commissioners and to Mrs.

Mormon and her attorney, Mr. Galane, copies of affidavits which have been taken in
the office of the City Attorney from witnesses who appeared there on behalf of the
Child Welfare Board to make statements and they are before the Commissioners at this
time.

The Child Welfare Board is here this evening and it is my understanding their chairman 
is present and prepared to make a statement as to the position of the Board and
each member of said Board is also present and prepared to make statements and answer
any questions.

JACK PURSEL: As chairman of the Child Welfare Board, I would like to present to you
the basis on which the recommendation of revocation was made. The
basis of the recommendation is upon complaints, investigations and evidence and 
findings which have been made by the members of the Child Welfare Board who are here
tonight to state specifically the results of their investigations. The five charges
as set forth in the citation on which the Child Welfare Board bases its 
recommendations are as follows:

1.	Failure to properly isolate or remove one or more children from nurseries upon
discovering that said child or children had a contagious disease.

2.	Failure to provide adequate supervision in said child nurseries.

3.	Improper treatment of children while in said nurseries.

4).      Failure to comply with ordinances, rules and regulations of the City of Las
Vegas.

5.       Failure to cooperate with the Child Welfare Board in operation of said nurseries.

I would be pleased to call upon the Child Welfare Nurse and the various members of
the Child Welfare Board.

His Honor Mayor Gragson requested that he do this, and Mr. Pursel called upon
the Child Welfare Nurse, Diane Schnaer, to speak. However, at this point, Mr.
