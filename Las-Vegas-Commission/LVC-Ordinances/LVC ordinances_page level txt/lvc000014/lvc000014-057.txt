of Las Vegas and thereafter it shall be filed in the office of the City Clerk and numbered, and
notice thereof, as provided in the City Charter, shall be given to all persons whose names
appear thereon, and to all persons interested, of the time when said Board of Commissioners
and Ex-officio City Assessor will meet to review the assessment, at which time the said
Board of Commissioners shall hear any and all suggestions and objections that may be filed
against the said assessment, and shall at that, or some adjourned meeting, correct the same
or confirm it as reported or corrected, or they may refer it back to the Ex-officio City

Charter directed, until the same shall be confirmed by the Board of Commissioners; when said
assessment roll has been confirmed by the Board of Commissioners, the City Clerk shall make
an endorsement upon the said assessment roll showing the date of confirmation as provided
in the Charter and shall thereupon deliver said roll, as confirmed by the Board of Commissioners
with his certificate of such confirmation and of the date thereof, to the County Assessor,
acting ex-officio City Assessor, shall thereupon, without extra compensation record the said

such recording. Whereupon from said date all persons shall be deemed to have notice of the con-
tents of the same and when said roll is so endorsed and recorded, it shall be prima facie
evidence in all courts and tribunals of the regularity of all proceedings preliminary to the
making thereof, and of the validity of said assessments and assessment roll, by the Board of
Commissioners. After the said special assessment roll has been confirmed and recorded, the
several amounts levied thereon, shall be due and payable and shall constitute and be a lien

directing the issuance of bonds for the amount of the said taxes or assessments remaining
unpaid by the said property owner, at the expiration of the said fifty days from the date of
the confirmation and recording of the assessment roll, fixing the form of bond, declaring the
amount remaining unpaid, denominations and interest, and lots or parcels of land against which
the said assessments remaining unpaid, in whole or in part, are a lien and the names of the
owners thereof, where known, with the amounts due thereon, and directing that the said unpaid
assessments, or portions thereof, shall thereafter be paid as follows: in equal annual install-
ments, provided, however, that the first installment may be for a greater or lesser amount
than the remaining installments; each of said installments shall bear interest from the end
of said fifty days until due, at the same rate of interest as shall be fixed by Ordinance; such
installments and the interest thereon shall be and remain a lien upon the said lots and parcels
of land and premises until paid; said installments and the interest thereon may be collected
in the same manner as other delinquent assessments, and the Board of Commissioners in the ordin-
ance directing the issuance of said bonds may provide that the unpaid assessments, and portions
thereof, and the interest thereon, shall be placed on the State and County Tax Roll and be
collected in the same manner and at the same time as other State and County general taxes are
