LIQUOR LICENSE	The Commission again considered the application of Karl and Leo Frey (Leroy

Corp.) for a Tavern License and license for four slot machines at the Moulin
Moulin Rouge Hotel	Rouge Hotel, 900 West Bonanza; favorable police report on the applicants.

This application was held in abeyance for a full Board at the last regular
Held in Abeyance	meeting of the Board of City Commissioners.

Dr. James B. McMillan; representing the NAACP, advised the Commission they
had knowledge of accommodations being refused to colored people by the present
operators of the Moulin Rouge Hotel; despite the understanding that this would
not happen; and that the hotel would operate in a democratic manner; therefore,
they were objecting to this application and recommending that it be denied.

Mr. Leo Frey, one of the applicants; disagreed with this statement and stated
there were several colored residents presently registered at the hotel; and
that they did not deny lodging because of race; however; they did refuse
service to anyone disorderly. He advised the Commission no one would be
refused service in the bar because of race if they were granted this license.

His Honor Mayor Gragson asked how many rooms there were in the Moulin Rouge
Hotel and Mr. Frey replied there were 105. Mayor Gragson asked the attorney
what the ordinance required and Mr. Whitmore advised the ordinance provided a
tavern was permitted in a hotel having more than 100 guest rooms.

Commissioner Sharp asked Mr. Frey if he would operate this as an inter-racial
hotel and he replied they would not refuse anyone admission to the bar because
of race or color. Mayor Gragson stated he hoped Mr. Frey realized if this
application was granted, that all concerned, including the Commission and the
entire community, would expect the operation to be conducted in this manner.

Dr. McMillan cited an instance where certain people, who came here to the Mobil
Convention, had confirmed reservations at the Moulin Rouge and were refused
	lodging when they arrived. He added there was nowhere for colored visitors to

stay. He believed this hotel could be operated with dignity as an inter-racial
hotel and did not see why it should be operated differently.

Commissioner Elwell asked if there would be any objection if the establishment
was operated as an inter-racial hotel, and Dr. McMillan stated if the hotel
was operated as had been in the past, there would be no objection. Dr. McMillan
cited another instance where four negroes from California asked for reservations
and waited 45 minutes before they were finally given accommodations. He added
this hassle to get rooms caused trouble which they did not want. Mr. Frey
stated that when colored people came into their place, they were not treated
any differently than anyone else.

Commissioner Fountain stated Mr. Frey was one of the original prime investors
who invested in and opened this as an inter-racial hotel in the west section
of the City, and moved this application be denied. Mr. Frey stated he bought
it in Bankruptcy Court. David Hoggard addressed the Commission, stating he
had attended a meeting when members of West Las Vegas agreed with what Mr. Frey
told them at that time, but since then the situation had changed. He added he
did not believe Mr. Frey was sincere when he said he would operate this as an
inter-racial hotel and that he (Mr. Frey) had used such excuses as renting only
to permanent guests or by the week when colored people had tried to rent
lodging. Mr. Hoggard said, because of the peculiarity of this location, he
was in favor of Commissioner Fountain's motion to deny this license at this time.
