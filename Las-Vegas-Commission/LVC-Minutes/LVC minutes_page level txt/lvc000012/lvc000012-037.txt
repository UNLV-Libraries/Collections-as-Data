Mr. James A. Brennan, Attorney, informed the Commission that since the last
meeting his client, Robert D. Lawrence, had gone to Texas and taken care of
four outstanding warrants by paying fines; that it took only one day to
accomplish this and Mr. Lawrence left for San Diego the following day. He
stated the fact that it took Mr. Lawrence only one day to take care of
these outstanding warrants was a good indication of what Texas thought of
its own laws and how serious these charges were. He reminded the Commission
that he previously pointed out the significance of these charges, as
illustrated by Look Magazine. Mr. Brennan stated the very actions his
client was arrested for in Texas were now legal in Texas.

Mr. Brennan informed the Commission that Mr. Lawrence had previously operated
in Las Vegas, under local laws, for sometime; that he had operated the Bar
of Music on the Strip and, during this time, Mr. Lawrence's record was
100% clean. It was necessary for Mr. Lawrence to go to Texas because he had
substantial investments there and had to protect them; however, he did not
operate a dive or anything of that nature in Texas, but had some fine
entertainment, such as the Treniers and Johnnie Mathis, and, as a matter of
fact, conducted such a fine establishment that it caused the other Clubs to
suffer. It was Mr. Brennan's thought that although there were approximately
12 or 14 violations, it was indicative of the seriousness of these charges
that on the 12th or 14th violation the fine was the same as on the first
violation. He stated if a person were picked up in Las Vegas 12 or 14
times, he would be fined the maximum of $500.00 and spend six months in
jail.

Commissioner Fountain inquired if Mr. Lawrence went back and cleared up 4
warrants in two days by posting and forfeiting a bond.

Mr. Brennan stated Mr. Lawrence had done this previously but since the last
Commission meeting Mr. Lawrence had spent one day in Texas and cleared up
4 warrants by paying a nominal fine on each one.

Mayor Gragson stated this was done on outstanding warrants, but Mr.

Lawrence had previously posted bail on those warrants.

Commissioner Fountain inquired if Mr. Lawrence was a paid employee at
Peyton Place.

Mr. Brennan replied in the affirmative and continued by stating that in
Texas they elect a wet Sheriff to keep the people down there happy. He
stated he did not think Las Vegas should give any more recognition to Texas
Blue Sky Laws than is given to New England Blue Sky Laws; that it was
ridiculous to have to operate under such laws; further, he couldn't see the
laws his client violated in Texas were more serious than someone engaging
in gambling outside the State of Nevada, except in the latter instance the
person was more or less lucky and did not get caught. It was Mr. Brennan's
opinion that the ambiguity of the Texas laws should be taken into consideration.
He requested the Commission to disregard Mr. Lawrence's actions in Texas,
which covered a small portion of his client's lifetime, and, instead,
consider his past and present history while in Las Vegas. Mr. Brennan
pointed out that Mr. Lawrence had no record before going to Texas; that
Mr. Lawrence has had a Clark County Sheriff's card and a Police Department
card, and his employment at Peyton Place justified the fact that he is a
citizen who can be trusted to operate this type of business. Mr. Brennan
concluded with the statement that Mr. Lawrence's brief stay in Texas was the
only thing against him in his lifetime and requested that the Commission
pass his client and not hold Mr. Lawrence's brief stay in Texas against him.

Commissioner Sharp inquired whether Mr. Lawrence would be willing to appear
before the Board and to this Mr. Brennan replied that he would.

Commissioner Sharp moved the application of Robert D. Lawrence for a 50%

- interest in Patrick's Peyton Place be held in abeyance.
