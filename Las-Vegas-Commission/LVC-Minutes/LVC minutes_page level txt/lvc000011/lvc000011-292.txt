(CALL OF SPECIAL MEETING)

the following members present:

CITY ATTORNEY APPOINTMENT

His Honor Mayor Baker opened the meeting with the statement that this was a Call of a
Special Meeting and at this time he would like to turn the gavel over to Mayor Pro Tem Whipple
and nominate Calvin Cory for City Attorney.

Commissioner Fountain asked if there had been any discussion as to a second man. Mayor Pro
Tem Whipple stated that there had been no official discussion and that he had proposed the
name of Jack Pursel the other day when Commissioner Sharp was here but the meeting did not
materialize.

Mayor Baker stated that he might qualify his nomination by adding that he had no objection to
Jack Pursel but that he felt Mr. Cory would more adequately serve as City Attorney due to his
past experience.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple said that he would like to turn the gavel back to Mayor Baker and
nominate Jack Pursel for City Attorney.

Commissioner Fountain said that they were going to have to move in some direction on this
appointment and stated that Calvin Cory was acceptable to him and asked if he was appointed
if his term would be for the unexpired term of the City Attorney. City Attorney Hawkins
stated that in his opinion the appointment at this time would be for the unexpired term of
the City Attorney unless the legislature made a charter change.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple stated that there didn't seem to be a second for either one of the
nominations and suggested each write a name on a piece of paper and put it in a hat; then he
asked if anyone else had any other suggestions.

Commissioner Fountain asked if there had been any mention as to who the assistant will be.

Mayor Pro Tem Whipple was of the opinion that the appointment of a City Attorney should be
made and the matter of the deputy left to the City Attorney and the City Manager.

Mayor Baker stated that they were apparently at an impasse. Commissioner Fountain asked if he
would be allowed to second either of these nominations. City Attorney Hawkins advised that a
second was not necessary. Commissioner Bunker suggested they call for a vote.

Commissioner Fountain seconded the nomination of Calvin Cory. He added that he thought they
were both good men but that Mr. Cory was more experienced. Motion was carried by the following
vote:	Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, and His Honor Mayor Baker voting aye; noes, none. Mayor

Pro Tem Whipple voted aye but stated that he would like to qualify his vote so that the record
would show that his first choice was Jack Pursel; however, he voted to make the appointment
unanimous.

Commissioner Fountain suggested that they contact Harris Sharp by telephone right away. Mayor
Pro Tem Whipple said that Commissioner Sharp had stated that either one of these two men would
be acceptable to him. Commissioner Bunker said that he thought they should get Commissioner
Sharp on record.

City Attorney Hawkins stated that the motion should be for the "appointment for the unexpired
term of office of the City Attorney, the appointment to be effective February 1, 1959."

A discussion was held during which it was decided that the City Manager should appoint Mr. Cory
as	City Attorney as soon as possible in order to give him an opportunity to acquaint

himself with the job pending Mr. Hawkins' actual resignation and Mr. Cory's entering on the
office of City Attorney, February 1, 1959.
