prior to the day of the sale, the owner may pay the amount of all unpaid installments, with interest there-
on at ten percentum per annum, and all penalties accrued, and shall thereupon be restored to the right

said County and to extend the same in a special column for special assessments on said tax roll, and the
County Reassurer of said County, the Ex-officio City Treasurer and Ex-officio Tax Collector of the City of
Las Vegas, is hereby authorized and directed to collect the same, all in the same manner and at the same
time as other State and County taxes are collected.

Section 15. That the special assessments, both principal and interest, when collected, shall
be placed in a special fund to be known as "Street Improvement Assessment District No. 100-7, Bond Interest
and Redemption Fund," and as such shall at all times constitute a sinking fund for and deemed specially
appropriated to the payment of the special assessment improvement bonds and interest thereon, to be hereafter
authorized, sold, issued and delivered for the purpose of paying in part the cost or expense of said im-
provements; and said fund shall be applied to payment for the improvements for which said assessments were
made, and shall not be used for any other purpose until said bonds and the interest thereon is fully paid.

Section 16. That after said assessment roll has been confirmed and approved, said Ex-officio City
Treasurer immediately shall notify each person known to said Ex-officio City Assessor, whose name appears
on said assessment roll, by United States of America mail, that an assessment has been levied against said
person and the designated property in said Street Improvement Assessment District No. 100-7, and shall state
therein when and where said assessment is due and payable.

Section 17. That all action (not inconsistent with the provisions of this ordinance) heretofore
taken by the City of Las Vegas, and the officers of said City, directed toward the improving of a certain
street by installing a complete street lighting system in the said Street Improvement Assessment District
No. 100-7, toward the creation of said District, and toward levying and effecting special assessments to
defray the entire cost thereof, be, and the same is hereby ratified, approved and confirmed.

resolutions and ordinances, in conflict with this ordinance, are hereby repealed.

for any reason, be questioned or be held invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the
remaining provisions of this ordinance, but shall be confined in its operation to the specific sections,
sentences, clauses or parts of this ordinance so held unconstitutional and invalid, and the inapplicability
and invalidity of any section, sentence, clause or part of this ordinance, in any one or more instances shall
not affect or prejudice in any way the applicability and validity of this ordinance in any other instances.

Section 20. That by reason of the fact that the streets of the City of Las Vegas are inadequate
to meet the present and future needs of the City and its inhabitants and that it is necessary immediately

  to raise funds to improve said streets, therefore, it is hereby declared that an emergency exists, and that
this ordinance is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety.

Section 21. That the City Clerk and Clerk of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas,
