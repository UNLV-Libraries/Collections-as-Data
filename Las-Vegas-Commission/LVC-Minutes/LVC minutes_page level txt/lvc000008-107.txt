annum, payable annually at the office of said Ex-officio City Treasurer, the first annual payment
of interest being due and payable on the said 1st day of June, 1953 and the remainder of said
annual installments of interest being due and payable on the 1st day of June in each year there-
after. Failure to pay any installment, whether of principal or interest, when due, shall cause
the whole of the unpaid principal to become due and payable immeidately, and the whole amount of
the unpaid principal and accrued interest shall thereafter bear penalty at the rate of ten per
centum per annum, until the day of sale, but at any time prior to the day of sale, the owner may
pay the amount of all unpaid installments with interest thereon, and all penalties accrued, and
shall thereupon be restored to the right thereafter to pay in installments in the same manner as
if default had not been suffered. The owner of any property not in default as to any installment
or payment, may, at any time, pay the whole of the unpaid principal with interest accruing there-
on to the next interest paying date.

Each assessment, together with interest thereon, shall be placed on the tax roll of Clark
County on and against the several owners and premises, and the County Assessor of Clark County,

the same on the tax roll of said County and to extend the same in a special column for special
assessments on said tax roll, and the County Treasurer of said County, the Ex-officio City Treasu-
rer and Ex-officio Tax Collector of the City of Las Vegas is hereby authorized and directed to
