LAS VEGAS, CLARK COUNTY, NEVADA
AUGUST 12, 1937

Minutes of a recessed regular meeting of the Board of Commissioners of the City
of Las Vegas held on the 12th, day of August 1937 at the hour of three o'clock P.M..

Present: Mayor L. L. Arnett, Commissioners H.P. Marble and Joe S. Ronnow- City
Attorney Harry H. Austin and Deputy City Clerk Le Roy Whipple.

Absent: Commissioners, Herb Krause and H. L. Perry and City Clerk Viola Burns.

The meeting had been called for the purpose of getting the expressions from the
local Electrical Contractors, together with Mr. Anthony Sanders head of the local
Building and Trades Council in regards to the issuing of an Electrical contractors
license to one a Mr. R. E. Swigart to operate within the City of Las Vegas and to
do electrical work therein. Mr. Swigart claimed to have previously taken the re-
quired electrical masters examination to work and operate in the City of Las Vegas
and therefore claimed exemption from retaking such an examination to again operate
as an electrical contractor within said City of Las Vegas -

Due to the fact that two of the Board of City Commissioners were absent, and
after serious consideration on the matter, it became the unanimous opinion and con-
sent of all present that a later meeting should be called where upon a full rep-
resentation of all the City Board members would be present and a full expression from
all could be heard.

There being no further business appearing before the Board at this time, the
meeting recessed and adjourned until Monday the 16th, day of August 1937 at the
hour of three o'clock P. M.
