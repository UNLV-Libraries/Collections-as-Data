est shall thereafter draw interest at the rate of ten per centum per annum, until the day of sale, but at
any time prior to the day of the sale, the owner may pay the amount of all unpaid installments, with inter-
est thereon at ten per centum per annum, and all penalties accrued, and shall thereupon be restored to the
