A resolution prepared by the City Attorney was submitted for consid-
eration and the Commission requested that a clause be inserted to
indicate that the right to this water cannot be assigned without
the consent of the City.

Thereafter, Commissioner Sharp moved the following resolution be
adopted:

WHEREAS, the City of Las Vegas is completing a new Sewage Dis-
posal Plant and there will be a surplus of effluent water from the
City's Sewage Disposal Plant, and

WHEREAS, the effluent water from said Sewage Disposal Plant
will be carried off in an open ditch and will create a problem for
the said City in disposing of the same, and

WHEREAS, the Las Vegas and Lake Mead Stakes of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints own certain real property adjacent
to the property owned by the City on which said Sewage Disposal Plant
is located, to-wit:

Northwest One-Quarter (NW¼) of Section 15,

T21S, R62E, MDB&M,

and

WHEREAS, the said Las Vegas and Lake Mead Stakes desire to ir-
rigate and cultivate the aforesaid land and have applied to the
State Engineer for a secondary permit to use six second feet of the
effluent water from the City of Las Vegas Sewage Disposal Plant, and

WHEREAS, the City of Las Vegas holds a primary permit for the
use of the effluent water and a secondary permit cannot be granted
without the consent of the holder of the primary permit, and

WHEREAS, the Las Vegas and Lake Mead Stakes have proposed to the
City of Las Vegas that they be granted the right to divert and carry
away at their own expense up to six second feet of effluent water,
thus assisting in the City's problem of disposal of effluent waters,
and such a proposal is of benefit to the City,

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED as follows:	That the City of Las

Vegas grant unto the Las Vegas and Lake Mead Stakes of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints a secondary right to divert and use
up to six second feet of the effluent water from the City of Las Vegas
Sewage Disposal Plant for beneficial use on the following described
land, to-wit:

Northwest One-Quarter (NW¼) of Section 15,

T21S, R62E, MDB&M,

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this grant shall continue from year
to year so long as the Grantee shall put the said waters to beneficial
use, and so long as the Las Vegas Sewage Disposal Plant is in operation
at its present location and producing effluent water. In the event
the Sewage Disposal Plant should be abandoned at its location, or that
less than six second feet of effluent water shall be available, then
the City shall be under no obligation to permit the Grantee to use
sewage effluent except insofar as such effluent may be available after
the primary right of the City of Las Vegas shall have been satisfied.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this grant is on the condition that
the Grantee takes the effluent water and transports the same from the
Sewage Disposal Plant at Grantee's own expense, and shall hold the
City harmless by reason of any injury or damage to person or persons
that may result therefrom.

The point of diversion shall be at the last unit of the chlorinator
on the said Sewage Disposal Plant in a twenty-inch (20") pipe and run-
ning from that point to the property of the Grantee herein described.

A control valve shall be installed at the expense of the Grantee at
the point of diversion. In the event such point of diversion shall
later prove impracticable then the Grantee shall have the right to
divert water from the waste ditch of the chlorinator at such a loca-
tion that may be mutually agreed upon by the Grantor and Grantee.

The Grantee shall have the right to install and maintain a pipe
from the point of diversion herein described across land of the Gran-
tor to the land of the Grantee for the purpose of conveying the ef-
fluent water hereinabove mentioned.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the right to use said water shall be
at no charge to the Grantee, in consideration of the matters and things
to be performed as herein set forth by the Grantee for the benefit of
the City, and
