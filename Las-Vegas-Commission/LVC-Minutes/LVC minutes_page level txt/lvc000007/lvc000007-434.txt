PARKING METER HOODS         At this time the report from the Police Department dated August 13, 1951
	regarding the use of paper sack hoods over parking meters by construction

men and the like, was read to the Board.

Discussion was held at which time Mr. Jack Young stated that he felt that
an annual license, or the issuance of a license plate to show the fee had
been paid for the use of parking over the allotted time by a contractor,
would less complicate matters. Mr. Young suggested we contact such cities
as Salt Lake City, Ogden, Utah, and Idaho Falls where such ordinances are
in effect to see how they work out this problem.

Commissioner Peccole moved the foregoing recommendation of the Police
Department in regard to meter hoods be accepted and put into operation.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Jarrett, Peccole and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple
