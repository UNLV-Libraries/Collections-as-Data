steps are necessary to make the contagious disease ward at Southern

on duty examine children and admit them, if he saw fit, as only the
Doctor on duty could do this.

It was the suggestion of City Attorney Cory that the City should go
on record as requesting this type of service be afforded.

Commissioner Fountain moved that the request of the Chairman of the
Child Welfare Board be approved and steps taken, as recommended by
