Clark County, Nevada, acting Ex-officio City Treasurer and Ex-officio Tax Collector of the City
of Las Vegas, Nevada, within one week after said special assessment roll is confirmed and approved,
without interest and without demand; provided, that all such assessments, or any part thereof, may
at the election of the owner, be paid in installments, with interest, as hereinafter provided.

Failure to pay the whole assessment, or any part thereof, within said period of one week shall be
conclusively considered and held an election on the part of all persons interested, whether under
disability or otherwise, to pay in such installments. In case of such election to pay in installments,
the unpaid assessments shall be payable at the office of said Ex-officio City Treasurer in ten
substantially equal annual installments of principal, the first of which installments of principal
shall be due and payable on or before the 1st day of August , 1953, and the remainder of said
installments shall be due and payable successively on or before the same day in each year there-
after until paid in full, with interest in all cases on the unpaid and deferred installments of
principal from the 1st day of August, 1952, at the same rate of interest as that provided for in
the special assessment bond to be hereafter authorized, sold, issued and delivered, but not to
exceed seven per centum (7%) per annum, payable annually at the office of said Ex-officio City
Treasurer, the first annual payment of interest being due and payable on the said 1st day of
August, 1953, and the remainder of said annual installments of interest being due and payable
on the 1st day of August in each year thereafter. Failure to pay any installment , whether of
principal or interest, when due, shall cause the whole of the unpaid principal to become due and
payable immediately, and the whole amount of the unpaid principal and accrued interest shall
thereafter bear penalty at the rate of ten per centum per annum, until the day of sale, but at
any time prior to the day of the sale, the owner may pay the amount of all unpaid installments,
with interest thereon at ten per centum per annum, and all penalties accrued, and shall there-
upon be restored to the right thereafter to pay in installments in the same manner as if default
had not been suffered. The owner of any property not in default as to any installment, or payment,
may, at any time, pay the whole of the unpaid prinicpal with interest accruing thereon to the
next interest paying date.

acting Ex-officio Assessor of the City of Las Vegas, is hereby authorized and directed to enter
the same on the tax roll of said County and to extend the same in a special column for special
assessments on said tax roll, and the County Treasurer of said County, the Ex-officio City Treasurer
and Ex-officio Tax Collector of the City of Las vegas, is hereby authorized and directed to collect

sections, sentences, clauses or parts of this ordinance so held unconstitutional and invalid, and the
inapplicability and invalidity of any section, sentence, clause or part of this ordinance, in any
one or more instances, shall not affect or prejudice in any way the applicability and validity of this
