This bond and the interest thereon shall be payable from a special fund designated "Street Im-
provement Assessment District No. 100-6 Bond Interest and Redemption Fund," containing the receipts upon
the collection thereof from the special assessments levied against and secured by a lien upon property in
Street Improvement Assessment District No. 100-6, which fund is and shall continue to constitute a sinking

shall be insufficient to pay said bonds and the interest thereon as they become due, the deficiency shall
be paid out of the City's general fund.

Said special assessments made and levied to defray said cost, with accruing interest thereon,
constitute a lien upon and against the property upon which such assessments were made and levied from and

proved by the Board of Commissioners of said City.

It is hereby certified, recited and declared that all acts, conditions and things essential to
the validity of the bond exist, have happened and have been done in due time, form and manner as required
by law, and that the total issue of said improvement bonds of said City for said improvements and inciden-
tal expenses, including this bond, does not exceed the amount authorized by law nor the special assessments
levied to cover the cost of said improvements.

It is hereby further certified, recited and declared that the proceedings, with reference to mak-
ing such improvements and levying the assessments to pay therefor, have been regularly had and taken in
compliance with law, and that all prerequisites to the fixing of the assessment lien against the property
benefited by the improvements and of the personal liability of the owner or owners of such property therefor
have been performed.

This bond is subject to the condition, and every holder hereof by accepting the same agrees with
the obligor and every subsequent holder hereof, that (a) the delivery of this bond to any transferee shall
vest title in this bond and in the interest coupons attached hereto in such transferee to the same extent
for all purposes as would the delivery under like circumstances of any negotiable instrument payable to
bearer; (b) the obligor and any agent of the obligor may treat the bearer of this bond as the absolute owner
hereof for all purposes, and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary; (c) the principal of and
the interest on this bond shall be paid, and this bond and each of the coupons appertaining thereto are
transferable, free from and without regard to any equities between obligor and the original or any inter-
mediate holder hereof, or any set-offs or cross-claims; and (d) the surrender to the obligor or any agent
of the obligor of this bond and each of the coupons shall be a good discharge to the obligor for the same.

signed by its City Clerk, and the annexed coupons to bear the facsimile signatures of said officials, and
