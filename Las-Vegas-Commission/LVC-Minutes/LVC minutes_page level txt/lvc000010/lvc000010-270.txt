hearing on this matter. He further reported that he had written again asking if the Public
Service Commission were going to appoint a private investigator or would allow the City
to employ an engineer to check the record prior to the hearing, but had not received an
answer to his letter as yet. He indicated that the letter from Mr. Allen sounded as though
they would consider whether or not the Telephone Company needed a rate raise.

WHEREAS, general plans for the proper development of this area can be worked out

that the hereinafter described area be annexed to the City of Las Vegas in accordance with

cated written approval of the annexation of this area to the City of Las Vegas, but a small
