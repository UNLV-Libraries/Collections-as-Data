being due and payable on the said 1st day of December 1951. and the remainder of said annual installments
of interest being due and payable on the 1st day of December in each year thereafter. Failure to pay any
installment,whether of principal or interest, when due, shall cause the whole of the unpaid principal to be-
come due and payable immediately, and the whole amount of the unpaid principal and accrued interest shall
thereafter draw interest at the rate of ten per centum per annum, until the day of sale, but at any time
prior to the day of the sale, the owner may pay the amount of all unpaid installments, with interest there-
on at ten per centum per annum, and all penalties accrued, and shall thereupon be restored to the right
thereafter to pay in installments in the same manner as if default had not been suffered. The owner of any
property not in default as to any installment or payment, may, at any time pay the whole of the unpaid princi-
pal with interest accruing thereon to the next interest paying date.

priated to the payment of the special assessment improvement bonds and interest thereon, to be hereafter
