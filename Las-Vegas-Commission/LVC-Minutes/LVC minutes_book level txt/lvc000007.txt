His Honor asked if there were any persons present who wished to object to this assessment.

Mr. John Sulawske asked why there was a difference in the assessed values of the lots.

Mr. Oglesby explained there were only three lots in this district that had not
been raised in their assessed valuation by the Clark County Board of Equaliza-
tion, and the property owners of these lots had appeared at the meeting of the
Board of Equalization and objected to the raise. 

Mr. Emerson D. Williams said that he had not received notice of the meeting
of the Board of Equalization, and therefore had no chance to attend this
meeting.

not at least feet deep he and others will not be able to connect. City Manager
George O. Treem, checked this and said that it will be deep enough.

tification of the meeting of the Board of Equalization.

could do about the lots that had not been raised in assessed valuation. This
matter will have to be taken up with the Clark County Board of Equalization
when they meet next July.

March 7, 1950

TO:	E. W. CRAGIN, Mayor,

and BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS.

With reference to your question as to whether or not the City can refuse to purchase mat-
erial or parts from a company being picketed and thus prefer a company that is not involved
in a labor dispute, I submit the following for your information: -

The decisions of the courts are uniform in holding that municipalities may not specify
that their contracts be performed by union labor nor may they agree to accept or limit bid-
ding only from contractors who employ union labor or who are not engaged in union difficul-
ties. (See letter from this office dated December 29, 1949, and the authorities therein
cited.)

This rule not only applies to the performance of contracts with the City but also applies
to the purchase of supplies and materials, the general rule being well settled that it is the
duty of public officials to make purchases at the lowest price possible for the benefit of
the public, and that such preferential treatment as suggested in the questions above would
tend to prevent competition and increase the cost of government to the taxpayers.

The courts further hold that such practices would be an unjust discrimination in favor
of or between certain classes of citizens which would tend to create a monopoly and restrict
competition and, in effect, require the Commission in some instances to violate the duties of
their office in that they could not accept bids from the lowest responsible bidder nor could
they obtain supplies and materials at the lowest cost available.

The authorities appear to be uniform and numerous on this subject. Therefore, I have
not attempted to set them forth herein. Suffice it to say that McQuillin on Municipal Corp-
orations and American Jurisprudence are clear in enunciating the foregoing rules. It there-
fore follows that any action on the part of the City Commission, in purchasing supplies and
materials for the City from only persons or organizations that are not involved in union
difficulties would not be a valid exercise of the power vested in the Commission for the

reason that its specific duty is to obtain materials and supplies at the lowest and best  

price obtainable.

ordered filed.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote: Commissioners

Bunker, Moore, Peccole, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Thereafter Commissioner Peccole made the following comment, and requested it be made a part
of the record:

Commissioner Peccole: I want to take this opportunity to criticize the Civil Service Board in the way

they handled this investigation, in the way they tried to make a farce out of the investigation from be-
ginning to end by the inference in one of the local newspapers that it was a comedy, for the statements made
by at least one member of the Civil Service Board during questioning of the witnesses, and for the conduct

of the attorney for the four officers., Harry Claiborne. I believe that the Civil Service Board was too

interested in what the downtown politicians had to say about the dismissal of the four officers and interested to
the point where they spent money in getting information and sending investigators forth to acquire evidence

to acquit or to dismiss the charges against the four police officers. I criticize the downtown politicians

for making it possible for a full Civil Service Board to be present at the "hearing. I further criticize the
Civil Service Board for the delay in taking action and bringing forth a decision in their investigation of this

case. I also refute that according to their testimony and their statements in this decision, they found

complete evidence that there was a conspiracy in this case. I also criticize the manner and method in which
they criticized the investigation carried on concerning the activities of Stanley Halstead. I also want to
state that there has been dissension, disloyalty, and trouble within the Police Department for many, many years
and it has not come about since Archie Wells was appointed Acting Chief of Police. It was proved that the
former Chief, Malburg, could not handle the Police Department and that is the reason he resigned before the
Board took action to dismiss him. The trouble in the Police Department did not come about by the appointment of
Acting Chief Wells. It existed before he took that position and it will continue to exist until the entire
Police Department has a complete house-cleaning. In their statement where they accuse the City Commission
of failing to appoint a permanent Chief of Police, that was due to the fact that the City had more pressing
problems, which were of a financial nature, and I want to point out that the present City Manager, Chet

Shelley, reported to this Board that he would be ready to clean house in the Police Department in the near

future but that there were other pressing problems that needed his attention first. He reported this matter
to the Board of Commissioners on two or three occasions. This Board agreed that he should take care of more
important matters before he stepped into the Police Department and clean house. The City Manager advised
this Board that he wanted to cut the number of policemen in the Department and asked for the Board's permission.

He received it. This was done just prior to the dismissal of the four officers. Before the policemen", could	

be dismissed, the Police Department advised the Commission through the City Manager that four men were being
dismissed because of disloyalty. The Civil Service Board report states:"The Board finds that, despite the

mitigating circumstances heretofore recited in the findings, the four affected police officers have been
proven to have violated their duty and responsibilities to the City of Las Vegas, the Las Vegas Police De-
partment, and the Acting Chief of Police by failing to maintain in confidence matters within their know-
ledge or information which would materially affect the functions and administration of the police de-
partment and particularly matters affecting the efficiency and internal affairs of the department that the
said officers violated their obligation to the oaths taken by them as police officers upon their employment
by the Las Vegas Police Department when they freely and voluntarily, as admitted by their own testimony,
discussed confidential matters affecting the police department with a person not entitled or qualified to
receive such information, when they discussed matters of internal dissension and Conditions affecting the
successful operation of the department with a stranger and one not authorized to receive such information,
and when they complained concerning their personal grievances and made accusations concerning the Acting
Chief of Police and certain administrative personnel of the department to a person in no manner officially
or otherwise connected with the City of Las Vegas; that the actions of the said police officers are of a
serious nature contrary to the best interests and welfare of the police department and the City of Las Vegas,
and must therefore subject the said officers to strict disciplinary action." That, to me, would indicate
evidence enough that these men were not loyal to the City, not loyal to the Police Department, not loyal to the
people, but loyal to themselves only. Two of these officers have been before the Civil Service Board pre-
viously. Pete Reid admitted in writing that he took part in pernicious political activities as Chief Malburg
charged, and when he came to trial, the Civil Service Board did not call in the complaining witnesses, but
took the testimony of Chief Malburg entirely, who in turn had changed his attitude from prosecution to a
defending attitude. Mr. Pete Reid has been accused of carrying on individual investigations for the Golden
Nugget. Mr. Pete Reid was once discharged and a written order placed on the desk of the then Chief of
Police, Luther Horner. That dismissal slip disappeared because Chief Luther Horner was found dead the next
morning. Pete Reid criticized Commissioners Wendell Bunker and William Peccole to people on the street
after they were elected to office. Police Officer Pete Reid still goes about criticizing these two
Commissioners. Would you think that the Civil Service Board would be interested in this information, or do
they want to ignore it? The Civil Service Board states there is a lack of coordination between the ad-
ministrative head of the Police Department and the City Manager. This Board has been advised time and time
again as to what has been going on between the City Manager and the Acting Chief of Police. When the four
men were discharged the City Manager was contacted. He accepted the dismissals as he would any other
dismissal, and it was not up to the City Manager to disagree with his department head as long as he was
presented the facts. The Civil Service Board should have taken this into consideration. Did not the Civil
Service Board contact Mr. Halstead and then report to the newspapers and the local citizens that they were
unable to contact Mr. Halstead? The Civil Service Board states that Mr. Halstead was induced to come to Las Vegas.
Did they prove this point, and if they did why did they not make it public? The Civil Service Board admits
that the four affected officers were duped or tricked into engaging in conversation with Stanley Halstead
for the purpose of revealing certain conditions which existed and still exist within the Police Department
and to make statements of accusation concerning certain members of the Police Department. Were these
officers kidnapped and taken down there, and why was it that Officers Allen, Sweeney, and Peterson refused

You and each of you will please take notice that pursuant to a call this day
issued by Mayor Cragin, a Special Meeting of the Board of Commissioners of the
City of Las Vegas, Nevada, will be held in the Council Chambers at the City
Hall, 5th & Stewart, on the 30th day of June, 1950, at the hour of 3:30 P.M.

to go? These four men were the oldest men in the department. Should they not have had enough
experience and intelligence to disregard an invitation by a stranger whom they did not know, or ;
should they have consulted with their administrative head? It appears to me as an individual
that the Civil Service Board and certain members of the Police Department are more interested
in serving downtown political leaders than serving the City at large and paying all their
allegiance to the people of Las Vegas. The downtown people are further interested in appoint-
ing a Chief of Police. Why are they interested in appointing a Chief of Police, for their own
individual interests? Why shouldn't they be interested in allowing this Board to appoint the
Chief of Police? One reason the Board has failed to appoint a Police Chief previously is that
there is not enough courage among the members to appoint a Chief of Police who will serve all of
the people, and before the Chief of Police is selected in this City, I will divulge other in-
formation about people who are interested in appointing this Chief of Police unless a chief is
selected for the people. That's all I have to say.	

Commissioner Bunker: I have one statement I would like to make. I got a tremendous smile
out of the last paragraph of the Civil Service decision and I shall read it so you will all know
it: "It is the recommendation of the Board of Civil Service Trustees that immediate action be

taken by the City Commission of the City of Las Vegas to appoint a permanent Chief of Police,
and in so doing that they give particular attention to the qualifications of the man appointed
with respect to his length of experience, knowledge of police procedure and administrative ability
to insure against a repetition of a like situation and to re-establish the confidence of the
public in the police department at the earliest possible date." It is my opinion that if
J. Edgar Hoover had to work with the four men we sent back to work, and some of the others on the
department, even he could never re-establish the confidence of the people of Las Vegas in the
Police Department.

There being no further business to come before this special meeting, Commissioner
Bunker moved the meeting adjourn.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Moore and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Moore,. Peccole, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes,none.

RESOLUTION - Housing	Commissioner Moore introduced and moved the adoption of the following

Authority Low Rent	resolution:

Housing Project

Street Improvements                 WHEREAS, the Housing Authority of the City of Las Vegas, hereinafter referred

	to as the "Authority" was duly organized under the Nevada Housing Authorities Act by a

	            resolution of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, hereinafter referred

	to as the "City", passed and adopted on the 6th day of June, 1947;

WHEREAS, in contemplation of the construction by the Authority of a low-rent
housing project within the corporate limits of the City, the Authority and the City
entered into a Cooperation Agreement on the 26th day of October, 1949;

WHEREAS, in connection with the proposed low-rent housing project, the City in
Paragraph 6 (b) of said Cooperation Agreement agreed as follows:

"In respect to any Project the City further agrees that within a reasonable
time after receipt of a written request from the Local Authority:

"(b) it will accept necessary dedications of land for, and will
grade, improve, pave, and provide sidewalks for, all streets
bounding such Project or necessary to provide adequate access
thereto (in consideration whereof the Local Authority shall
pay to the city such amount as would be assessed against the
Project site for such work if it were privately owned)."
WHEREAS, pursuant to application of the Authority, the Public Housing Administra-
tion has approved a program reservation for one hundred (100) dwelling units for the
proposed low-rent housing project in the City;

WHEREAS, the Authority has started negotiations for and contemplates purchasing
approximately twenty (20) acres of ground on the Westside, Las Vegas, Nevada commonly
known as the Harper Property, as a site for the proposed low-rent project;

WHEREAS, under the proposed improvement plan for the said site, the project will
be bounded by three streets, namely, H. Street on the East, Washington Avenue on the
north, and McWilliams Street on the South;

WHEREAS, the Authority has requested that the City improve, pave and provide
sidewalks for the above-mentioned three streets bounding the proposed project,
concurrently with the construction of the proposed project by the Authority, and in
consideration whereof, the Authority has agreed to pay the City such amount as would
be assessed against the project site for such improvement work if the said property
were privately owned;

WHEREAS, the City recognizes the obligation under the above mentioned Cooperation
Agreement but is unable to fulfill its obligations with respect to the three bounding
streets at the present time for the following reasons:

(a)	The customary method of paving streets and providing side-
walks and other improvements in the City is to create an
assessment district with the property on each side of the
street bearing-one-half of the cost of improvements. In
the case of streets bounding the proposed project the
private property abuting the said streets on the opposite
sides is not high enough in value to support an assessment
district and pay its one-half share of improvements.

(b)	The City does not have general funds presently budgeted and
available for such street improvements.

WHEREAS, in view of the inability of the City to presently fulfill its obligations
under the Cooperation Agreement with respect to the said bounding streets, the Authority is
willing, in connection with its overall construction program, to provide sidewalks for and
pave one-half of the above-mentioned three bounding streets, provided the City will:

(a) On or before the completion of the proposed project gravel
and oil coat the other one-half of the said streets.

(b) On or before July 1, 1953, either by assessment or through
funds provided in the regular budget, complete the paving
of the remaining one-half of the said three bounding streets.

WHEREAS, since the cost to the Authority for paving one-half of the three bounding
streets in connection with its overall construction program will be approximately the same
amount as if the City paved all of said streets and assessed the Authority for its share,
the Authority should not be assessed any further amounts by the City when the said
City completes the other one-half of the paving;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED:	That if the Authority acquires the approximate

twenty (20) acres on the Westside, and commonly known as the Harper Property, and constructs
thereon a low-rent housing project and in connection therewith provides sidewalks and paves
one-half of the three bounding streets known as H Street, Washington; Avenue and McWilliams
Street, that the City will:

1.	On or before the completion of said project gravel and oil coat
the other half of said streets.

2.	On or before July 1, 1953, either by assessment or through funds provided

in the regular budget, pave the remaining one-half of the said three streets
bounding the project.

3.	Will consider the funds spent by the Authority for paving the one-half of said
streets as being in lieu of what the Authority would have been required to pay
if the City had paved all of said streets and assessed the Authority for its
share, as if privately owned and will, therefore, not make any assessment
against the said Authority when the other one-half of said three streets are
paved.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Moore and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple voting
aye} noes, none. Absent: Mayor Cragin and Commissioner Peccole.

FREMONT STREET -	Commissioner Moore moved the local Casino Operators be granted

Permission to	permission to blockade Fremont Street from Main Street to Second

Blockade	Street on Friday September 29, 1950 from 6:30 P.M. to 12:30 A.M.



Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following
vote: Commissioners Bunker, Moore and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem

Whipple voting aye; noes, none. Absent: Mayor Cragin and

Commissioner Peccole.

There being no further business to come before this special meeting,
Commissioner Moore moved this meeting adjourn.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following
vote: Commissioners Bunker, Moore and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem

Whipple voting aye; noes, none. Absent: Mayor Cragin and

The report is as follows:

Las Vegas, Nevada
April 23, 1951

Honorable E. W. Gragin, Mayor 
and Members of the City Commission
of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada

Gentlemen:

Your committee appointed to make recommendations concerning the zoning of property west of H Street
Las Vegas, Nevada, hereby reports, and makes the following recommendations:

I.       That a 100 foot highway be constructed from a point where J Street intersects with the
north city limits of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, thence running southward through
the middle of the Zaugg tract to Bonanza Road, This would necessitate a slight bend
or deviation on the west end of the so-called Harper property# This step of the pro-
posed new highway will be referred to hereinafter as Step No. 1. Step No. 1 of this
highway is to contain a planting strip or parkway in the center thereof, which is to
be planted with trees or shrubs of a suitable nature, or whatever the City Park Depart-
ment might feel is appropriate.

The right-of-way for this portion of the highway is to be obtained immediately, the
City to designate sufficient personnel to make the necessary survey, draw up the
proper deeds, and to solicit the necessary property owners to convey and dedicate
this portion of the highway to the City; the City either to acquire this right-of-way
within ninety (90) days or to proceed within ninety (90) days to acquire the same by
condemnation. It is the concensus of opinion of the committee that most of this land
could be obtained by voluntary conveyance from the various owners.

Step No. 2 would consist of an extension southward of Step No. 1, the proposed highway
to be extended from Bonanza Road to connect on to Shadow Lane, and in that manner to
intersect with Charleston Boulevard at a point immediately east of the Clark County
Hospital, this proposed portion of the highway to be known as Step No. 2, and the
right-of-way to be obtained as soon as convenient, and graded by the City. Step No.

1 of the proposed highway would be graded immediately, as soon as the right-of-way
could be obtained.
Step No. 3 would be the extension of the proposed highway from the point where J Street
intersects the northerly city limits, thence running eastward, extending said highway
to connect with Main Street at the approximate point where Main Street intersects with
the northern limits of the City of Las Vegas, this proposed step to be completed at
some convenient time in the future.

II.     That portion of the Zaugg Tract lying east of J Street to be rezoned from R-E to R-1;
that portion of the Zaugg Tract lying west of J Street to remain zoned as at present,
that is, R-E; that portion of the Zaugg Tract lying between J Street and K Street to
be additionally restricted by an amendment to the zoning ordinance providing that no
residence may be constructed in said area having square footage of less than 1,000
sq. ft., exclusive of carports, garages and other residential building appurtenances;
also, that portion of the Zaugg Tract lying between K Street and Highland Avenue
to be additionally restricted by amendment to the zoning ordinance to provide that no
dwelling may be constructed thereon having less than 1200 sq. ft. of area, exclusive of garages,
carports and other residential appurtenances.

 That the zone change in regard to the so-called Harper property being requested by the City
Housing Authority be granted to permit this particular twenty acre tract to be rezoned to R-2.

III.  That on the occasion of the next vacancy in the City Housing Authority that the City Commis-
sion give consideration to  the appointment of some resident of the areas affected by the
location of the Public Housing project.

IV. That the office of the City Attorney be directed to proceed immediately to abate all of those
structures now on the Zaugg Tract, which have been built in violation of the zoning laws, or
which have been built in violation of the zoning laws, or which may be existing at the pre-
sent time under conditions constituting, a nuisance; that the City Attorney's office be in-
structed to give special attention to this particular property with a view to eliminating
all sub-standard shacks from the Zaugg Tract.

V.   That the Office of the City Building Inspector be given specific instructions strictly to
enforce the zoning regulations, with reference to the Zaugg Tract, and to make periodic
inspections to make certain said city zoning laws are being enforced.

It is the concensus of opinion among the members of your committee that the zoning laws in
this section have not in the past been strictly enforced, and that this has resulted in much
dissatisfaction on the part of citizens of Las Vegas residing in Bonanza Village and on West
Bonanza Road.

Respectfully submitted,

s/ Robert E. Jones ___________

s/ J. David Haggard___________

s/ Maxwell Kelch _____________

s/ William Peccole
s/ A. C. Grant _

INVESTIGATION OF DR. BERNSTEIN'S GAMING LICENSE RENEWAL

TO:	BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS

FROM:	HOWARD W. CANNON, CITY ATTORNEY
Pursuant to the instructions of the Board of Commissioners that I in-
vestigate the above named application in connection with his request
for a renewal of gaming license for the Eldorado Club, Inc., I wish
to advise as follows:

Dr. Berstein owned a 10% interest in the Fremont Arcade
acquired in 1941 with Roscoe Thomas, Art Ham and Guy McAfee. This
interest was sold to Guy McAfee in 1950.

In 1944 Dr. Bernstein acquired a 7½% interest in the Frontier
Club with the same group above mentioned and on or about the year 1947
sold this 7½% interest to one Alex Block. In 1950 he purchased two-thirds
     (2/3) of the real property upon which the Frontier business is located
from Messrs. Wengert and Ronnow and still owns that 2/3 interest. In
1950 he purchased 2½% of the Frontier Club stock from Mr. Schellang and
still owns this interest.

In 1944 Dr. Bernstein purchased and owned 10% in the El Rancho
Vegas and later in the same sold his interest to Wilbur Clark. At the
time his interest was acquired in this operation the other owners were
Messrs. Clark, Barish, and Wilkerson.

Dr. Bernstein acquired a 6% interest in the Golden Nugget at the
time of its organization and building and later sole 2% of this amount.

He has owned since its inception, and still owns, 4% of this business.

His realty holdings in the past in the Las Vegas area include the
co-ownership of the Flamingo Hotel real property, prior to the building of
the hotel, with Mr. Wilkerson. In addition he owned real property in
Henderson, Nevada.

In 1945 Dr. Bernstein purchased the lease on the premises sub-
sequently occupied by the Eldorado Corp., Clover Club, etc. Thereafter, a
suit was brought in the Federal Court for an accounting as a result of
claimed failure to pay the amounts due Dr. Bernstein on the lease. This
matter was settled by a sale by Dr. Bernstein and the payments to him by
Mr. Rosen and other operators. The operators of the business got into
difficulty involving their licenses late in the year 1950 and being de-
linquent in their payments the Dr. went into possession as of December,

1950, to protect his leasehold interest. Thereafter a license was granted
to Eldorado Club for the 1st quarter, 1951, with Dr. Bernstein as president
of the corporation and Attorneys Louis Wiener and Dave Zenorr as the other
officers. The second quarter, 1951, the license was issued to the Eldorado
Corporation, Inc., dba the Clover Club with the same officers. The third
quarter 1951, a renewal was applied for with Dr. Bernstein as president of
the corporation and Mr. Hibbs and Mrs. Chandler as the other officers. Dr.
Bernstein operated the Eldorado Club during the months January, February
and March, 1951, and claims to have operated at a profit. Thereafter, due
to difficulty with Mr. Silvagni, the owner of the premises, a nominal oper-
ation was continued so that the lease would not be violated and the licenses
cancelled. During the 2nd Quarter, Mr. Binion purchased Silvagni's 1/2
interest of the slot machines for $175,000, by payment of $50,000 cash with
a note due January, 1952, in the sum of $62,5000 and a note due in January,

1953 in the sum of $62,5000 with Dr. Bernstein required to co-sign on the
notes. Thereafter Binion purchased the bar from Matt Howard and Binion and
Dr. Bernstein entered into an agreement for the sale and purchase, respec-
tively, of the Eldorado Club, including the lease holdings. Mr. Binion was
to pay $50,000 of the Eldorado corporate debts assumed by Dr. Bernstein in
the total amount of $87,000 and Dr. Bernstein to pay the remaining sum of
$37,000, which was done. Mr. Binion was further to pay to Dr. Bernstein
$1500 a month plus 12½ of the net profits. When Mr. Binion could not ac-
quire a State License the sale was voided with Mr. Binion given an option to
purchase on the same conditions for a two year period provided he obtains a
license. In the meantime, Binion started to remodel the premises and spent
approximately $350,000. An audit is now being made to determine the exact
amount Binion has put into the premises and after this has been completed
the corporation will give its note to Mr. Binion for that amount of money.

Dr. Bernstein is the sole stock holder of the corporation and claims no
other person has an interest in the corporation. He further advises that
he intends to start with a bank roll of $100,000 and can raise $150,000 with-
in three (3) days if necessary. The corporation owes no debts except a claim
by Ira Goldring in the amount of $5100.00, which is disputed, and one other
bill in the sum of approximately $60.00. Dr. Bernstein further represents
that Mr. Pat Collins will act as manager of the operation. In my investigation
of licenses it appears that Dr. Bernstein was not on the license nor an
officer of the corporation at the time the license came in jeopardy. The
record in the City Hall shows further that Dr. Bernstein was on the Golden
Nugget license for the last quarter of 1949, first quarter of 1950, and
second quarter of 1950. The third quarter of 1950 the Golden Nugget ap-
pears as a corporation and Dr. Bernstein was not listed as one of the officers.
The Doctor does not appear on the Eldorado Corporation license nor any other
corporation licensed for the Apache Hotel premises, prior to the first quarter
of 1951, and he was licensed both by the State and the City for the first and
second quarter of 1951.
A member of the State Tax Commission was contacted by me and advised that the
Commission had no objection to Dr. Bernstein and that his record would justify the re-
newal of the license, and that the foregoing facts had been disclosed to them. This
report was presented to, and gone over with me by Commissioner Reed Whipple.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Jarrett and carried by the following vote:

Commissioners Bunker, Jarrett, Peccole and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Absent: Commissioner Whipple.

There being no further business to come before this special meeting, Commissioner
Jarrett moved this meeting adjourn.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote:

Commissioners Bunker, Jarrett, Peccole and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Absent: Commissioner Whipple.

Commissioner Peccole moved the resolution as presented by the Chamber of
Commerce be adopted.

R E S O L U T I O N

Under Public Law #139, signed by the President last week, it appears
	that outright grants of federal funds may be available for certain purposes

in officially-declared defense areas.

Among these purposes are housing and water facilities.

Inasmuch as both of these rank high on the development agenda of this
community, we deem it important that the possibilities of securing federal
funds to assist our area in coping with its housing and water problems be
thoroughly canvassed.

To that end we ask that the Las Vegas Nevada Chamber of Commerce
communicate on our behalf with the office of the Administrator, Housing
and Home Finance Agency, asking that an official survey be made to deter-
mine whether this area may qualify for federal funds for its housing and
water problems under the terms of Public Law #139.

Commissioners Bunker, Peccole, Jarrett, and His Honor Mayor Pro Tem Whipple
