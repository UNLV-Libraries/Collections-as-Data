Commissioner Bunker asked what would be the status of property owned by
the City within the boundaries of a proposed unincorporated town, should
the unincorporated town be legally formed. Commissioner Bunker made
particular reference to a public notice of hearing on April 8, 1957, re-
garding a proposed unincorporated town east of the City which he thought
would include the new sewer plant and other City-owned property to the
east.

City Attorney Cannon advised the Commission that such property could be
taken into and included in an unincorporated town and that the City should
protest, should they not desire City property to be included in an unin-
corporated town.

Commissioner Bunker requested that a map be drawn of the proposed unincorp-
orated town to determine what City property might be affected.

City Manager Kennedy reported that the map would be available very shortly.

Commissioner Bunker moved that the City enter an official protest of in-
clusion of property owned by the City within the proposed unincorporated
town.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Bunker, Fountain, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes,
none. Absent:	Commissioner Sharp.
