ORDINANCES AND PARTS OF ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT HEREWITH, AND  OTHER
MATTERS PROPERLY RELATING THERETO,” was first proposed and read by
title to the Board of City Commissioners on the 6th day of December
1946 at a Special Meeting and referred to Commissioners Bates and
Corradetti for recommendation. Thereafter the said committee re-
ported favorably on the said ordinance on the 7th day of December,

1946	which was the next regular meeting of said Board of City
Commissioners. The proposed Ordinance was read in full to the
Board of City Commissioners as first introduced.

Thereafter Commissioner Bates moved the adoption of said ordinance
 on its first reading.

Commissioner Clark moved that Mr. George H. Wood be retained by the
City of Las Vegas as auditor and consultant for the calendar year

1947	at the following rate:

Supervising Senior,	in Charge	$35.00	per	day

Senior Accountants	30.00	”	”

Semi-Senior Accountants	25.00	”	”

Junior Accountants	20.00	”	”

Office Assistants - in preparation and

report	work	15.00	"	”

The City to pay travelling and hotel expenses as 

heretofore. These expenses have been comparatively nominal, 

especially in view of the fact that we have generally had four or
more men employed on the audit at the same time and that 

overtime rates are not charged.

I estimate that the total cost will be approximately
$2,500.00 and will not exceed $3,000.00

voting aye; noes, none. Absent:	Commissioner Baskin.
