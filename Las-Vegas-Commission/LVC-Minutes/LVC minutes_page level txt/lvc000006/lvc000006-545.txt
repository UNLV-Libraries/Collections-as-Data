RESOLUTION NO. 104

WHEREAS, the Government of the United States of America, during the recent war time
emergency, constructed, acquired and established Sewer War Public Works facilities identified
os Project No. Nev. 26-116-F and consisting generally of a disposal plant, pipes, pipelines,
accessories and facilities for the conveyance of sewage, together with certain lands or
interests in lands, in or near the City of Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada, and

WHEREAS, the Government of the United States of America, by instrument in writing
dated July 1, 1946, leased the aforesaid Project to the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, and by
provision in said instrument granted to said City the option, during the original term of
said lease, or any renewal thereof, to purchase all of the Government's right, title and
interest in and to the leased property for the agreed and stipulated consideration of the
principal sum of Three Hundred Twenty Thousand Dollars ($320,000.00), less the amount of all
rental payments made under said lease, plus interest computed at the rate of three per cent
(3%) per annum on the principal sum or balances thereof, and

WHEREAS, the City of Las Vegas is now considering the acquisition of all of the Govern-
ments' right, title and interest in and to the aforesaid Project, by and through its exercise
of the option aforesaid, and

WHEREAS, a technical engineering investigation now discloses that the sewer works of
said Project have depreciated at a far greater rate than that anticipated at the time of the
execution of the option agreement aforesaid and assumed as the basis for the fixation of a
fair valuation of said Project to be paid by the City of Las Vegas upon the exercise of its
option to purchase the same, and

WHEREAS, in the light of the facts, revealed by said investigation, that deterioration
in said sewer works is progressing at a spiraling rate, resulting in an excessively increased
flow of infiltrated ground waters, necessitating the additional fixed cost of treating the
same, and that the utility life of said works is consequently considerably shorter than that
contemplated at the time of the execution of said option agreement, obviously requiring an
earlier retirement and replacement of said works, it now appears that the valuation of said
Project as reflected in the consideration expressed in the option agreement for the purchase
of said Project by the City of Las Vegas failed to take into account circumstances sub-
sequently developing and unforeseen at the time of said agreement which would have materially
effected a reduced and more accurate and equitable valuation, and

WHEREAS, it was the intention of the parties at that time to express a consideration
which reflected a reasonably accurate, fair and equitable valuation of said Project, now,
therefore, be it

RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, in regular session this
29th day of September, 1947, that it respectfully urge and request the Government of the United
States of America, through its duly constituted agencies, to re-open and re consider the question
of the valuation of the Project aforesaid, and join with the City of Las Vegas in an examination
of all the facts and circumstances now known or available having any bearing upon a determination
of a more accurate, fair and equitable consideration to be paid by said City upon the exercise
of its option to purchase said Project.
