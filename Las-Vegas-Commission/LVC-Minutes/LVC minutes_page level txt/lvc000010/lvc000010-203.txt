Motion seconded by Commissioner Sharp and harried by the following vote:	Com-

missioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

Commissioner Bunker stated that the SWIT Basketball Tournament of last week
sponsored by the Las Vegas Review Journal was an outstanding event, and re-
quested that the City Manager write a letter to the sponsorers commending
them on this tournament.

City Attorney Howard W. Cannon reported that the City Treasurer has three
checks that have been returned and needs advice from the Commission as to
what should be done about them. Mr. Cannon explained that in July of 1955
a Mr. Owen McCann applied for an Advertising and Solicitors license to con-
duct a campaign for a benefit for the North Las Vegas Firemen's Association.

Mr. McCann gave checks to the City for $15.00 for police investigation fee,

$10.00 for the advertising license and $55.00 for the solicitors license fee
for two months. He thereafter absconded with the Firemen's Association funds
and the three checks were returned to the City. The North Las Vegas Fire-
men's Association have attempted to collect their money, but have been unable
to locate Mr. McCann. They are willing to make good the $15.00 and $10.00
checks, but do not wish to reimburse the City for the $55.00 solicitors li-
cense fee.

Commissioners Fountain moved the City Treasurer be authorized to write off
the $55.00 check as an uncollectable debt.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Bunker and carried by the following vote:	Com-

missioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

There being no further business to come before the Board, Commissioner Bunker
moved this meeting adjourn.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	Com-

missioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.
