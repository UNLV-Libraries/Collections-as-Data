Commissioner Sharp moved the following resolution be adopted and order made:

RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, BONANZA UNDERPASS, located within the City of Las Vegas, is a
state highway connecting route and construction and control must necessarily
be coordinated between the State Highway Department and the City of Las Vegas; and

WHEREAS, said underpass is woefully inadequate to handle the present
traffic by reason of the tremendous population growth within the City of
Las Vegas and more specifically due to the population growth and housing
developments to the West of said underpass; and

WHEREAS, over a period for more than a year, representatives of the City
of Las Vegas have held numerous conferences and corresponded with the State
Highway Department Officials in an effort to reach agreement concerning the
enlargement or new construction of said underpass; and

WHEREAS, investigation has shown that an overpass over Bonanza would be
more practicable since it would avoid the necessity of obtaining more land
and it would also avert the necessity of the large expense of extensive
drainage and controlling underground water and seepage; and

WHEREAS, the State Highway Department had agreed to install a second
traffic lane at or adjacent to the present underpass, at the estimated cost
of $550,000, upon the City securing the necessary right-of-way; and

WHEREAS, the City is agreeable to pay the difference between this cost and
the sum necessary to construct an overpass,

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners of the City
of Las Vegas, at a regular meeting thereof held on the 18th day of November, 1959,
that the State Highway Department is urged to take prompt action in the construction
of an overpass at the same point where Bonanza Underpass now is and that the
State Highway Department make the necessary estimates so that this City may be
advised their portion of the expense in order to budget and provide funds for
the same;

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this Board places itself on record that such
planning, designing, budgeting of funds and construction be treated as urgent
in order to alleviate the present traffic hazard at said underpass;

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Board of City Commissioners has endeavored
to promote said construction and that cooperation and action are earnestly
requested from the State Highway Department.

ADOPTED AND APPROVED this 18th day of November, 1959.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Fountain and carried by the following vote:
Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor Mayor Gragson
voting aye; noes, none.

AMBULANCE SERVICE	City Manager Kennedy presented the Commission with financial and equipment

CONTRACT	reports of the Mercy Ambulance Service and the Las Vegas Emergency Ambulance

Service, which had been requested by the Commission on August 5, 1959, when
Held in Abeyance	consideration had been given the participation of the Las Vegas Emergency

Ambulance Service in the contract with the City presently held by the Mercy
Ambulance Service.

Mr. Kennedy stated that, upon checking over the reports, Mercy Ambulance 
equipment was in very good shape, with vehicles well-maintained and qualified as
emergency equipment, as required by the Police Department; furthermore, the
financial position of this company was sound. In regard to the Las Vegas
Emergency Ambulance Service, he said their financial condition was not 
outstanding, but for a small growing business it was not bad; however, when a
Police Department representative and two mechanics from the City Garage went
to check their equipment on two different occasions, they were unable to find
anyone there. They inspected the equipment on the premises and the report on
the same was far from satisfactory and only one piece of equipment was found
that was passable as emergency equipment out of four, one of which was not
useable.
