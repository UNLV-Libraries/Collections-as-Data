Assistant City Attorney Ralston 0. Hawkins advised the Commission that
he could not find anything specifically against Mr. Harris' accepting
the appointment in the Charter of the Civil Service Rules. Mr. Hawkins
stated that this was probably a policy matter, but he would like more
time to study the same.
