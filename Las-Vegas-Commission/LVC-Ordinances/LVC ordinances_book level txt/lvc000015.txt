Sec. 27. Variances, adjustments and appeals.

A.	The board of commissioners may in special or exceptional cases and under appropriate condi-
tions and safeguards, vary the strict application of this article in harmony with its general purposes and
intent, in accordance with rules and conditions set forth herein for the granting of variances and adjust-
ments as provided in this article.

B.	An application for any permissible variance or adjustment of regulation as provided herein,

shall be made to the planning commission in the form of a written application, such form to be known as "ap-
plication for variance." This application shall be filed with the office of the planning commission and
shall be made upon forms provided by the commission, and shall be verified by the owner of the lot or parcel
of land concerned in the application. The application for variance shall set forth the following informa-
tion,	facts, and exhibits all of which shall be maintained in the permanent files of the planning commission:

1.	The provisions or regulations of this article from which the property or building is sought

tion work	in accordance with plans within six (6) months after the effective date of the variance.

C.	The applicant shall present a statement and adequate evidence as part of such application

showing certain conditions and facts to be established. Such statement and evidence shall show:

1. That there are special, exceptional and extraordinary circumstances or conditions applying
to the property or to the intended use of the property under consideration which make compliance with the
provisions of this article,difficult and a cause of hardship to, and abridgement of property rights of, the
owner of such property.

2.	That such circumstances or conditions do not apply generally to other properties in the same
land use district.

3. That the granting of the variance is necessary to do substantial justice to the applicant for
variance or the owner of the property under consideration.

4.	That the granting of the variance will not result in material damage or prejudice to other
properties in the vicinity, nor be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare.

5.	That the granting of the variance will not adversely effect any master plan of the City.

D. The planning commission is authorized to make a uniform charge of twenty-five ($25.00) dol-
lars, payable to the City Clerk, to partially cover the cost of making maps, sending out notices, and other
incidental administrative expenses involved in any application for a variance or adjustment, this charge
being due and payable at the time of filing such application. The planning commission may designate its
planning engineer as its agent to receive and inspect any application for variance at the time of filing.

When it has been ascertained that such an application is in proper order and complies with the requirements
of this article, such application shall be approved for filing. No such application shall be filed unless
it comples with the requirements of this article.

E.	The planning commission shall hold a public hearing upon each properly submitted application

(10) nor later than thirty (30) days following the date of filing of such application or following the re-
ferral thereof to the planning commission who shall set the date for hearing and the applicant shall be
notified of the date of such hearing. The planning commission shall cause to be sent to each owner of pro-
perty within a distance of three hundred (300) feet of the exterior boundary of the lot or parcel of land

involved, and the provisions of this article from which a variance is sought. For the purposes of this
section, "Property owner" shall mean that owner shown upon the latest assessment rolls of the comity.

From the	time of	filing such application until the time of such hearing, the application, toge-
ther with all plans and other data submitted, shall be available for public inspection in the office of the

planning commission.

F.	The planning commission shall cause to be made by its own members or its planning engineer
as its agent when assigned for the purpose, an investigation of facts bearing on any application for var-
iance sufficient to assure that the action taken on each variance is consistent with the intent and purpose
of this article.

G. The planning commission shall hear and consider evidence and fact from any person at the
public hearing, or shall consider written communication from any person relative to the granting of a
variance. The right of any person to present such evidence shall not be denied for the reason that such
person was not required by this article to be informed of such public hearing.

H.	Within thirty (30) days from the conclusion of the public hearing the planning commission
shall render its decision unless such time limit be extended by common consent and agreement signed by
both applicant and the commission and made a part of the records pertaining to the application concerned.

If in the opinion of the commission the necessary facts and conditions set forth in this section apply
in fact to the property referred to in the application for variance and that the same comes within the
purview of the planning commission, it may grant the variance in whole or in part upon such safeguards as
it deems necessary. If, however, such facts and conditions do not prevail nor apply or if the granting

of the variance will adversely effect the property of persons in the vicinity of the applicant's property)
or for any other valid reason, the commission shall deny the application.

I.	The commission in granting a variance, may establish conditions under which a lot or parcel
of land may he used, or a building constructed or altered, or make requirements as to architecture, height
of a building or a structure, open spaces, parking areas or vehicle storage, and conditions of operation
of any enterprise, or may make any other conditions, requirements, or safeguards that the commission may
consider necessary to prevent damage or prejudice to adjacent properties or detriment to the city. When
necessary, the commission may recommend and the board of commissioners may require guarantees in such
form as deemed proper under the circumstances, to insure that the conditions designated in connection
therewith are being or will be complied with.

J.	A written report of the decision of the planning commission shall be transmitted to the
board of commissioners and a notice of such decision sent by registered mail to the applicant for variance
not more than three (3) days after such report is transmitted to the board of commissioners.

After having rendered a decision the planning commission shall, not reverse its findings
and make another determination of any variance unless pertinent facts or conditions not known to the plan-
ning commission at or prior to the date of decision are subsequently disclosed. Such new facts and condi-
tions shall be set forth in detail in an application for a rehearing before the planning commission and
filed in the office thereof not more than ten (10) days after the report of the decision of the planning
commission has been transmitted to the board of city commissioners.

K.	The decision of the planning commission, either for the granting with or without conditions
or the denial of an application for variance, shall become final and effective on the tenth (10) day
following approval of such decision by resolution of the board of city commissioners and the recording there-
of in the minutes of the board of city commissioners, unless within ten (10) days after the planning com-
mission has notified the board of commissioners in writing, of its decision:

1. The applicant or any owner of property, located within three hundred(300) feet of the ex-
terior boundaries of the property described in such application, and who appeared before the planning
commission either on the original hearing or pursuant to an application for rehearing shall appeal to the
board of commissioners by filing such appeal in writing with the City Clerk.

If an appeal is filed within the time specified, it automatically stays any proceedings
in the matter until a farther determination is made by the board of commissioners.

L.	At its next regular meeting after the filing of such an appeal, the board of commissioners
shall set a date for public hearing thereon not less than ten (10) nor more than thirty (30) days thereafter.
Notice of such hearing shall be given in the manner prescribed in paragraph E of this section, including
notice to the planning commission and the building inspector.

M.	The board of city commissioners shall proceed to hear any person or persons interested, and
after hearing such appeal and reviewing any further report of the planning commission, may sustain, reverse
or modify the decision of the planning commission by a majority vote of the board of commissioners.

The decision of the board of city commissioners shall be final and conclusive in such appeal.

N. Any variance or adjustment approved by the planning commission and granted by the board of
commissioners, as herein provided for, shall be conditional upon the privileges granted being utilized with-
in six (6) months after the effective date of the variance. In the event some construction work is involved,
it must actually commence within the stated period and must be diligently prosecuted to completion; other-
wise the variance is automatically voided. A lapse of work for a period of three months will be sufficient
to cause the invalidity of the zone variance.

Section 2. All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are hereby expressly re-
pealed.

Section 3. This Ordinance shall be in full force and effect upon its publication as in the
next section provided,.and final passage.

Section A. The City Clerk and Clerk of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas shall

hereof for all purposes, and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary; (c) the principal of and

transferable, free from and without regard to any equities between obligor and the original or any inter-
mediate holder hereof, or any set-offs or cross-claims; and (d) the surrender to the obligor or any agent
of the obligor of this bond and each of the coupons shall be a good discharge to the obligor for the same.

countersigned by its City Treasurer, and its corporate seal to be affixed hereto and attested and counter-
signed by its City Clerk, and the annexed coupons to bear the facsimile signatures of said officials, and

making such improvements and levying the assessments to pay therefor, have been regularly had and taken in
compliance with law, and that all prerequisites to the fixing of the assessment lien against the property
benefited by the improvements and of the personal liability of the owner or owners of such property there-
for have been performed.

the obligor and every subsequent holder hereof, that (A) the delivery of this bond to any transferee shall

owner hereof for all purposes, and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary; (C) the principal
of and the interest on this bond shall be paid, and this bond and each of the coupons appertaining thereto
are transferable, free from and without regard to any equities between the obligor and the original or

any agent of the obligor of this bond and each of the coupons shall be a good discharge to the obligor for
the same.

Section 6. That when said bonds have been duly executed the Treasurer of the City of Las Vegas shall
deliver them to Schwabacher & Co., San Francisco, California, and associates, the lawful purchasers thereof,
on receipt of the agreed purchase price. The funds realized from the sale of said bonds shall be applied
solely to acquiring, constructing and establishing additional sanitary sewer trunk lines and interceptors
to the existing municipal sewerage system, but the purchaser of said bonds shall in no manner be responsible
for the application or disposal by said City, or by any of its officers, of any of the funds derived from
the sale thereof.

Section 7. That the interest falling due on said bonds on March 1, 1954, shall be paid out of the
general fund of the City of Las Vegas, or out of any other funds that may be available for such purpose, and
for the purpose of creating a fund for the payment of said bonds and the interest thereon, designated "Las
Vegas General Obligation Sewer Bond Fund, Series of September 1, 1953," there shall be levied in the year
1953, and annually thereafter, a tax on all property, both real and personal, subject to taxation within the
boundaries of the City of Las Vegas, including the net proceeds of mines, sufficient to pay the interest on
said bonds and to pay and retire the same as hereinabove provided; and provided further that in the prepara-
tion of the annual appropriation ordinance for the City, the Board of Commissioners shall first make proper
provision through the levy of sufficient taxes for the payment of the interest on and the retirement of the
principal of the bonded indebtedness of the City, and the amount of money necessary for this purpose, together
with the amounts necessary for the payment of the principal of and interest on the other bonded indebtedness
of the City, shall be a first charge against all the revenues received by said City. Nothing herein contained
shall be so construed as to prevent the City from applying any other funds that may be in the treasury of the
City and available for that purpose, to the payment of said interest or principal as the same, respectively,
mature, and the levy or levies provided for may thereupon to that extent be diminished. In any year in which
the total taxes levied by overlapping political subdivisions and taxing units in Las Vegas may exceed the
limitation of five cents on the dollar imposed by Section 2 of Article X of the Constitution of the State of
Nevada, and it shall become necessary by reason thereof to reduce the levies made in behalf of said City,
the reduction so made shall be in taxes levied for or by such City for purposes other than the payment of its
bonded indebtedness and interest thereon, and the taxes levied hereinafter for the payment of said bonded
indebtedness and the interest thereon shall always enjoy a priority over taxes levied for or on behalf of
such City for any other purposes where reduction is necessary in order to comply with the limitation of Section
2, Article X of the Nevada Constitution. Such tax shall be levied and collected in the same manner and at the
same time as other taxes are levied and collected, and the proceeds thereof shall be kept by the County
Treasurer in said special fund, designated "Las Vegas General Obligation Sewer Bond Fund, Series September 1,
1953,” which shall be used for no other purpose than the payment of principal and interest as the same falls
due. Such taxes shall be levied in the year 1953 and annually thereafter until all of said bonds and the
interest thereon shall have been fully paid, satisfied and discharged. Any sums coming due on said bonds at
any time when there are on hand, from such tax levy or levies, insufficient funds to pay the same, shall be
promptly paid when due from general funds on hand belonging to the City of Las Vegas, reimbursement to be
made for such general funds in the amounts so advanced when the taxes herein provided for have been collected.

Section 8. That it shall be the duty of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, annually,

at the time and in the manner provided by law for levying other city taxes, if such action shall be necessary

to effectuate the provisions of this ordinance, to ratify and carry out the provisions hereof with reference

to the levy and collection of taxes, and said Board shall require the officers of said City to levy, extend

and collect such taxes in the manner provided by law for the purpose of creating a fund for the payment of the
principal of said bonds and the interest accruing thereon. Such taxes, when collected, shall be kept for and
applied only to the payment of the principal of and interest on said bonds as hereinbefore specified.
Section 9. That the City Council does hereby find and declare that the life of the improvements
to be acquired and established out of the proceeds of the sale of said bonds shall and will be in excess of
twenty-five years from their date.

Section 10. That the officers of the City of Las Vegas be, and they hereby are, authorized and
directed to take all action necessary or appropriate to effectuate the provisions of this ordinance, includ-
ing, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the printing of said bonds and the execution of such
certificates as may be required by the purchaser thereof relating to the signing of the bonds, the tenure and
identity of the municipal officials, the assessed valuation and indebtedness of the City of Las Vegas, the
rate of taxes levied against the taxable property within the City of Las Vegas, the receipt of the bond pur-
chase price, and, if in accordance with the facts, the absence of litigation, pending or threatened, affec-
ting, the validity thereof.

Section 11. That all by-laws, orders, resolutions, and ordinances, or parts of by-laws, orders,
resolutions, and ordinances in conflict with this ordinance, are hereby repealed. After the bonds hereby
authorized have been issued, this ordinance shall constitute a contract between said City and the holder or
holders of said bonds, and shall be and remain irrepealable until said bonds and the interest accruing there-
on shall have been fully paid, satisfied and discharged.

Section 12. That if any one or more sections, sentences, clauses or parts of this ordinance shall,
for any reason, be questioned or be held invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the
remaining provisions of this ordinance, but shall be confined in its operation to the specific sections, sen-
tences, clauses, or parts of this ordinance so held unconstitutional and invalid, and the inapplicability
and invalidity of any section, sentence, clause, or part of this ordinance, in any one or more instances shall
not affect or prejudice in any way the applicability and validity of this ordinance in any other instances.

Section 13. That by reason of the fact that the sewers of the City of Las Vegas are inadequate to
meet the present and future needs of the City and its inhabitants, and that it is necessary immediately to
raise funds to install said sewers therefor, it is hereby declared that an emergency exists and this this
ordinance is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety.

Section 14. That the City Clerk and Clerk of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas
shall cause this ordinance to be published once a week for two successive weeks immediately following its
final reading and adoption in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, a daily newspaper published in said City, and
this ordinance shall become effective immediately following the second publication thereof.

(1)	Airfield means Nellis Air Force Base.

(2)	Flight hazard means any structure or tree or use of land which obstructs the airspace required
for the flight of aircraft in landing or taking-off, at any airport, or is otherwise hazardous to such
landing or taking off of aircraft.
(3)	Nonconforming use means any structure, natural growth, or use of land which does not conform to the
regulations prescribed in this ordinance, or any amendment thereto, as of the effective date of such
regulations or amendment.

(4) Person means any individual, firm, co-partnership, corporation, company, association, joint stock
association, or body politic, and including any trustee, receiver, assignee, or other similar representative
 thereof.

(5)	Structure means any object constructed or installed by man, including, but without limitation,
 buildings, towers, smoke-stacks, and overhead transmission lines.

(6)	Landing area means that part of the airfield that is used or intended to be used for landing and
taking-off of aircraft.

(7)	Board means the Board of Adjustment of the City of Las Vegas.

SECTION 3. Zones. In order to carry out the purposes of this ordinance, all of the land within the
boundaries of the City of Las Vegas, State of Nevada, and within 50,000 feet of the respective established
airfield reference points is hereby divided into height limiting zones, the boundaries of which and
the heights applicable thereto are shown on the Nellis Air Force Airfield Zoning Plan, numbered 2045
and dated 18 August, 1953; which is attached hereto and made a part hereof.

SECTION 4. Height Limit. Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance no structure or natural growth shall
be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in the height limiting zones hereinafter described to a
height in excess of the height specified therefor or established for such zone. For the purpose of this
Regulation, the following height limits above the reference point are established for each of the height

E Zone;	7:1 feet

F Zone;	20:1 feet

G Zone;	500 feet

SECTION 5. Nonconforming Uses. The regulations prescribed in Sections 3 and 4 of this ordinance shall
 not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or
 natural growth not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date hereof, or otherwise interfere
with the continuance of any nonconforming use.

SECTION 6. Variances. Any person desiring to erect any structure or increase the height of any structure,
or permit natural growth, or use his property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this
ordinance, may apply to the Administrative Agency set forth in Section 10 for a variance therefrom.

Such variance shall be allowed where a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result
in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public

interest but do substantial, justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this ordinance.



 SECTION 7. Permits.

(1)	Future Uses. No material change shall be made in the use of the land, and no structure or
 natural growth shall be erected, altered, planted, or otherwise specifically listed, tinless a permit

 therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each such application shall indicate the purpose for which
 the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use,
structure, natural growth would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is
in the affirmative, the permit applied for shall be granted.

(2)	Existing Uses. Before an existing use, structure, or natural growth may be replaced, substantially
altered or repaired, rebuilt allowed to grow higher, or replanted, within any of the specified height
limiting zones, a permit must be secured from the Administrative Agency authorizing such replacement,
change, or repair. No such permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of a
flight hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or natural growth to be made or become higher, or
become a greater hazard to air navigation that it was on the effective date of this ordinance or than it is
when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for a permit for
replacement, change, or repair of existing use, structure, or natural growth shall be granted.



SECTION 8. Hazard Marking and Lighting. Any permit or variance granted under Sections 6 or 7 may, if such
action is considered advisable to effectuate the purposes of this ordinance and reasonable in the circum-
stances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or natural growth in question to permit
the City of Las Vegas, at its own expense to install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights
as may be necessary to indicate to aircraft pilots the presence of a flight hazard.

SECTION 9. Appeals.

(1)	Any person aggrieved, or taxpayer affected, by any decision of the Administrative Agency made in its
administration of this ordinance, if of the opinion that a decision of the Administrative Agent is an
improper application of this ordinance, may appeal to the Board of Adjustment for which provision is made

in Section 11.

(2)	All appeals taken under this section must be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules
 of the Board, by filing with the Board and serving a copy on the Administrative Agency a notice of the appeal

 specifying the grounds thereof. The Administrative Agency shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the
 papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.

(3)	An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the

 Administrative Agent certified to the Board, after the notice of appeal has been filed with it, that by
 reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or
property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by order of the Board on notice to
the Administrative Agent and on due cause shown.

notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing any party
may appear in person or by agent or by attorney.

partly, or modify, the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and may make such order,
requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of
the Administrative Agent.

acted and its legal conclusions from such facts in reversing, or affirming, or modifying any order, require-
ment, decision, or determination which comes before it under the provisions of this ordinance.

order, requirement, decision, or determination of the Administrative Agent, or to decide in favor of the
applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this ordinance, or to affect any variation
in this ordinance.

trict No. 100-25,

property involved and the provisions of the article from which a variance is sought.

The Board may use any, or all, of the following methods of notification:

1.	By mailing a notice to each property owner shown on the latest assessment rolls of the

County, or Other available public records.	

2.	By the posting of a written notice, posted conspicuously at a minimum of two public places within

the purview of the Board of Adjustment, it may grant the variance in whole or in part upon such safeguards
as it deems necessary. If, however, such facts and conditions do not prevail nor apply or if the granting
of the variance will adversely affect the property of the persons in the vicinity of the applicant's prop-
erty, or for any other valid reason, the Board of Adjustment shall deny the application.
I.	The Board of Adjustment in granting a variance, may establish conditions under which a lot or
parcel of land may he used, or a building constructed or altered, or make requirements as to architecture,
height of a building or a structure, open spaces, parking areas or vehicle storage, and conditions of opera-
tion of any enterprise, or may make any other conditions, requirements or safeguards that the Board of Ad-
justment may consider necessary to prevent damage or prejudice to adjacent properties or detriment to the

the date of decision are subsequently disclosed. Such new facts and conditions shall be set forth in de-
tail in an application for a rehearing before the Board of Adjustment and filed in the office thereof not
more than ten (10) days after the report of the decision has been transmitted to the Board of City Com-
missioners.

or the denial of an application for variance, shall become final and effective on the tenth(lO) day follow-
ing such decision by resolution of the Board of City Commissioners and the recording thereof in the minutes

Section 7. That when said bonds have been duly executed, the Treasurer of the City of Las Vegas
shall deliver them to the lawful purchasers thereof, on receipt of the agreed purchase price. The funds

prior redemption premium due in connection therewith, there shall be levied in the year 1955, and annually
thereafter, a tax on all property, both real and personal, subject to taxation within the boundaries of
the City of Las Vegas, including the net proceeds of mines, sufficient to pay the interest on said bonds
and to pay and retire the same as hereinabove provided; and provided further that in the preparation of the
annual appropriation ordinance for the City, the Board of Commissioners shall first make proper provision
through the levy of sufficient taxes for the payment of the interest on and the retirement of the principal
of the bonded indebtedness of the City, and the amount of money necessary for this purpose, together with
the amounts necessary for the payment of the principal of and interest on the other bonded indebtedness of
the City, shall be a first charge against all the revenues received by said City. Nothing herein contained

the City and available for that purpose, to the payment of said interest or principal as the same, respec-
tively, mature, and the levy or levies provided for may thereupon to that extent be diminished.
In any year in which the total taxes levied by overlapping political subdivisions and taxing units in
Las Vegas may exceed the limitation of five cents on the dollar imposed by Section 2 of Article X of the

poses other than the payment of its bonded indebtedness and interest thereon, and the taxes levied herein-
after for the payment of said bonded indebtedness and the interest thereon shall always enjoy a priority
over taxes levied for on or behalf of such City for any other purposes where reduction is necessary in
order to comply with the limitation of Section 2, Article X of the Nevada Constitution. Such tax shall be
levied and collected in the same manner and at the same time as other taxes are levied and collected, and
the proceeds thereof shall be kept by the City Treasurer in each said special fund, which shall be used for
no other purpose than the payment, for the issue for which each fund has hereby been created, of principal
and interest due on said bonds and any prior redemption premium in connection therewith. Such taxes shall
be levied	in the year 1955 and annually thereafter until al1 of said bonds and the interest thereon shall

have been fully paid, satisfied and discharged. Any sums coming due on said bonds at any time when there

are on hand, from such tax levy or levies, insufficient funds to pay the same, shall be promptly paid when
due from general funds on hand belonging to the City of Las Vegas, reimbursement to be made for such gen-
eral funds in the amounts so advanced when the taxes herein provided for have been collected.

Section 9. That it shall be the duty of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas,

annually, at the time and in the manner provided by law for levying other city taxes, if such action shall
be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this ordinance, to ratify and carry out the provisions hereof
with reference to the levy and collection of taxes, and said Board shall require the officers of said City
to levy, extend and collect such taxes in the manner provided by law for the purpose of creating a fund
for the payment of the principal of said bonds and the interest accruing thereon. Such taxes, when col-
lected, shall be kept for and applied only to the payment of the principal of and interest on said bonds as
hereinbefore specified.

Section 10. That the City Council does hereby find and declare that the life of the improve-
ments to be acquired and established out of the proceeds of the sale of said bonds shall and will be in
excess of twenty years from their date.

Section 11. That the officers of the City of Las Vegas be, and they hereby are, authorized
and directed to take all action necessary or appropriate to effectuate the provisions of this ordinance,
including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the printing of said bonds and the execution

of such certificates as may be required by the purchaser thereof relating to the signing of the bonds,

of Las Vegas, the rate of taxes levied against the taxable property within the City of Las Vegas, the re-
ceipt of the bond purchase price, and, if in accordance with the facts, the absence of litigation, pending
or threatened, affecting the validity thereof.

resolutions, and ordinances in conflict with this ordinance, are hereby repealed. After the bonds hereby
authorized have been issued, this ordinance shall constitute a contract between said City and the holder
or holders of said bonds, and shall be and remain irrepealable until said bonds and the interest accruing

thereon shall have been fully paid, satisfied and discharged.

Section 13. That if any one or more sections, sentences, clauses or parts of this ordinance
shall, for any reason, be questioned or be held invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair or invali-
date the remaining provisions of this ordinance, but shall be confined in its operation to the specific
sections, sentences, clauses, or parts of this ordinance so held unconstitutional and invalid, and the in-
applicability and invalidity of any section, sentence, clause, or part of this ordinance, in any one or
more instances shall not affect or prejudice in any way the applicability and validity of this ordinance in

exists and that this ordinance is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
and safety.

to any equities between the obligor and the original or any intermediate holder hereof, or any set-
offs or cross-claims; and (d) the surrender to the obligor or any agent of the obligor of this bond
and each of the coupons shall be a good discharge to the obligor for the same.

WHEREAS, it has come to the attention of the Board of Commissioners that coin operated amusement
machines have been licensed and operating in close proximity to public schools; and

WHEREAS, the location of these machines in places of business in such close proximity to
schools is contrary to the public morals and welfare of the City of Las Vegas and tends to corrupt
the welfare and morals of students at said schools and churches; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners feel that it is in the public interest and for the promo-
tion of the general welfare of the people of the City of Las Vegas that the location of these
machines be limited to locations away from said schools and churches; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has determined that it is in the public interest to
restrict the playing of coin operated plunger type amusement machines or so-called pinball machines,
to persons over the age of 18 for the reason that such type of machines encourage gambling in
that no value is received therefrom,

NOW THEREFORE, the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas do ordain as follows:

a coin operated plunger type amusement machine or so-called pinball machine,
and any licensee who shall permit any person under the age of 18 to play a
coin operated plunger type amusement machine or so so-called pinball
machine held under such license, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

c)	Any person under 18 playing a coin operated plunger type amusement machine
or so-called pinball machine, shall constitute prima facie evidence of the
fact that such machine is played with the permission, knowledge and consent
of the holder of the license therefor.

d)	The playing of a coin operated plunger type amusement machine or so-called
pinball machine, by any person under 18 years of age shall constitute
sufficient grounds for the immediate revocation of the license issued

to any person for the coin operated plunger type amusement machine or so-
called pinball machine so played and all other licenses for similar types
of machines held by such operator.

e)	Any license heretofore issued for the operation of coin operated amusement
machines, may be revoked without notice if such license is issued to a place
of business within 500 feet of any school or church.

SECTION 2. Any violation of this ordinance, or any provision herein contained shall con-
stitute a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not to exceed
Five Hundred ($500.00) Dollars, and/or six (6) months in the City Jail, or a combination of both.

SECTION 3. All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are hereby repealed.

SECTION 4. That the City Clerk and Clerk of the Board of Commissioners of the City of
Las Vegas shall cause this ordinance to be published once a week for two successive weeks immediately

seeking an electrical contractor's license must be, or have in his employ, a master electrician; and
WHEREAS, the construction, installation, maintenance, alteration or repairing of neon and/or

anyone doing such work to hold an electrical contractor's license; and

installation, maintenance, alteration and repairing of neon and/or electrical signs are not as com-
prehensive as those of a master electrician in the City of Las Vegas; and

WHEREAS, there are presently several applications for licenses before the City of Las Vegas
for the construction, installation, maintenance, alteration or repair of neon and electric signs, which
applications should be acted upon, and wherein the applicants do not have a master electrician as now

license in accordance with the following conditions:

a)	The applicant shall be in possession of a valid, electric sign contractor's license issued
by the State of Nevada Contractors' Board.

b)	The fees, examination procedure and licensing procedure for master neon and/or electric
sign licenses shall be the same as those established for master electrician licenses.

c)	Any person, firm or corporation, who, at the time of the effective date of this ordinance,
is in possession of a valid electric sign contractor's license issued by the State of
Nevada, and who is engaged in, or has made application for a license to engage in the
business covered by this ordinance, shall be issued a master neon and/or electric sign
license by the Board of Electrical Examiners upon payment of the required fee and with-
out the requirement of taking an examination; provided, however, application for such
license under this clause must be made within ninety (90) days from the effective date

of this ordinance, and if not so made, any person, firm or corporation, whether in ex-
isting now, or in the future, shall apply for a master neon and/or electric sign license
and shall take an examination conducted by the Board of Electrical Examiners of the City
of Las Vegas.

d)	When applying for an Electric Sign Contractor's license from the City of Las Vegas,
the applicant shall have in his possession a valid Electric Sign Contractor's License
issued by the State of Nevada Contractor's Board, and either possess himself or have
someone in his employ who possesses a valid Master Neon and/or Electric Sign License
issued by the Electrical Examining Board of the City of Las Vegas.

SECTION 2. Nothin in this ordinance shall be construed to mean that the holder of an Electric
Sign Contractor's License shall be permitted to do any work connected with the electric service to
any sign other than to connect the sign to an existing service which is within ten (10) feet of the
sign, which service shall have been approved by the Department of Building and Safety prior to connect-
ing said sign.

SECTION 3. This ordinance shall not be construed to prohibit those persons, firms or

facilities and of such other funds as may legally be made available for their
payment?

sorting to ad valorem taxation; and

I.	Basic Speed Law

No person shall drive a vehicle upon a street or highway at a speed greater than is
reasonable or prudent having due regard for the traffic on, and the surface and width
of, the street or highway and in no event at a speed which endangers the safety of
persons and property.

II.	Prima Facie Speed Limit

The speed of any vehicle upon a street or highway not in excess of the limits specified
 in this section or established as authorized in this Code is lawful unless clearly
 proved to be in violation of the basic rules declared in Part I hereof.

 The speed of any vehicle upon a street or highway in excess of any of the limits speci-
 fied in this section or established as authorized in this Code is prima facie unlawful.
The prima facie limits referred to above are as follows and the same shall be applicable
 unless changed as authorized in this ordinance, and if so changed, then only when signs
have been erected giving notice thereof, in which event the speed designated on the sign
 shall be the prima facie limit:
A.	15 miles per hour

(1)	When passing a school building or the grounds thereof, contiguous to the street
or highway while children are going to or leaving such school during opening

or closing hours or during the noon recess period. Such prima facie limit

the street or highway by a fence, gate or any other physical barrier, while
such grounds are in use by children.

(2)	When traversing a grade crossing of a steam, electric, or any other motor rail-
way, if during the last 100 feet of the approach to such crossing the driver
does not have a clear and unobstructed view of such crossing and of any traffic
on such railway for a distance of 400 feet in both directions along such rail-
way. This subdivision shall apply in the case of any railway grade crossing
where a human flagman is on duty or clearly visible electrical or mechanical
railway crossing signal device is installed but does not then indicate the
immediate approach of a railway train or car.

(3)	When traversing any intersection of a street or highway if during the last 100
feet of his approach to such intersection the driver does not have a clear and
unobstructed view of such intersection and of any traffic upon all of the
street or highway entering such intersection for a distance of 100 feet along
all such street or highway, except on a through street or highway or at a
traffic controlled intersection.

B.	25 Miles per hour on all streets and highways unless a different speed limit is
posted as set forth in this ordinance or as provided in subsections A and C of
this section.

(1)	ON SAN FRANCISCO AVENUE for its entire length in the City.

(2)	ON FREMONT STREET, commonly known as Boulder Highway, beginning at Atlantic

or by a combination of both such fine and imprisonment.

SECTION 3. Chapter 36, Section 42, Code of Las Vegas, Nevada, 1949, as last
amended by Section 1, Ordinance No. 653, is hereby further amended to read as follows:

It shall be unlawful for any person, while either intoxicated or under the
influence of intoxicating liquor, or of stimulating or stupefying drugs, to
drive, or conduct any vehicle or have charge or control of any vehicle, on
any public street or alley within the City of Las Vegas. Any person who

ing to driving a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, the amount
of alcohol in the defendant's blood at the time alleged as shown by chemical analysis
of the defendant's blood, urine, breath or other bodily substance shall give rise to
the following presumptions:

(a)	If there was at that time 0.05 percent or less by weight of alcohol in
the defendant's blood, it shall be presumed that the defendant was not under
the influence of intoxicating liquor.

(b)	If there was at that time in excess of 0.05 percent, but less than 0.15
percent by weight of alcohol in the defendant's blood, such fact shall not give
rise to any presumption that the defendant was or was not under the influence
of intoxicating liquor, but such fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
(c)	If there was at that time 0.15 percent or more by weight of alcohol in

the defendant's blood, it shall be presumed that the defendant was under the

influence of intoxicating liquor.

SECTION 5. The provisions of Section 4 of this ordinance shall not be construed
as limiting the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the question
whether or not the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

SECTION 6. The Municipal Judge in imposing sentence for the violation of a pro-
vision of this ordinance shall not suspend the same nor any part thereof and it shall
be his duty upon the revocation of the operator's or chauffeur's license, within five
days, to forward a record of the conviction to the Department of Motor Vehicles of the
State of Nevada.

by repealed.

office of said Ex-Officio City Treasurer, the first annual payment of interest being
due and payable on the 1st day of March, 1959, and the remainder of said annual install-
ments of interest being due and payable on the 1st day of March in each year thereafter.
Failure to pay any installment, whether of principal or interest, when due, shall cause
the whole of the unpaid principal to become due and payable immediately and the whole
amount of the unpaid principal and accrued interest shall thereafter bear penalty at
the rate of ten per centum (10%) per annum, until the day of sale, but at any time
prior to the day of the sale, the owner may pay the amount of all unpaid installments,
with interest thereon at ten per centum (10%) per annum, and all penalties accrued, and
shall thereupon be restored to the right thereafter to pay in installments in the same
manner as if default had not been suffered. The owner of any property not in default as

with interest accruing thereon to the next interest paying date.

ment District No. 100-35 Bond Interest and Redemption Fund," and as such shall at all
times constitute a sinking fund for and deemed specially appropriated to the payment of
the special assessment improvement bonds and interest thereon, to be hereafter author-
ized, sold, issued and delivered for the purpose of paying in part the cost or expense
of said improvements; and said fund shall be applied to payment for the improvements
 for which said assessments were made, and shall not be used for any other purpose until
said bonds and the interest thereon is fully paid.

said Ex-Officio City Treasurer immediately shall notify each person known to said Ex-
Officio City Assessor, whose name appears on said assessment roll, by United States of
America Mail, that an assessment has been levied against said person and the designated
property in said Street Improvement Assessment District No. 100-35 and shall state there-
in when and where said assessment is due and payable.

SECTION 18. That all action (not inconsistent with the provisions of this
Ordinance) heretofore taken by the City of Las Vegas and the officers of said City,
directed toward the improving of East Charleston Boulevard by the laying of oil bound
gravel pavement thereon, and by constructing on both sides thereof concrete curbs and
gutters and concrete valley gutters wherever necessary, and installing sidewalks and
street lighting along the same in the said Street Improvement Assessment District No.
100-35, toward the creation of said District, and toward levying and effecting special
assessments to defray the entire cost thereof, be, and the same is hereby ratified, ap-

lutions and ordinances, or parts of by-laws, orders, resolutions and ordinances, in
conflict with this ordinance, are hereby repealed.

of this ordinance so held unconstitutional and invalid, and the inapplicability and
invalidity of any section, sentence, clause or part of this ordinance, in any one or
more instances shall not affect or prejudice in any way the applicability and validity
of this ordinance in any other instances.

SECTION 21. That by reason of the fact that the streets of the City of Las
Vegas are inadequate to meet the present and future needs of the City and its inhabi-
tants and that it is necessary immediately to raise funds to improve said streets,
therefore, it is hereby declared that an emergency exists, and that this ordinance
is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety.

  Treasurer, the first annual payment of interest being due and payable on the 1st day of
  April, 1959, and the remainder of said annual installments of interest being due and
payable on the 1st day of April in each year thereafter. Failure to pay any install-
  ment, whether of principal or interest, when due, shall cause the whole of the unpaid
principal to become due and payable immediately, and the whole amount of the unpaid
  principal and accrued interest shall thereafter bear penalty at the rate of ten per
centum (10%) per annum, until the day of sale, but at any time prior to the day of the
sale, the owner may pay the amount of all unpaid installments, with interest thereon
  at ten per centum (10%) per annum, and all penalties accrued, and shall thereupon be
  restored to the right thereafter to pay in installments in the same manner as if de-

  stallment or payment, may, at any time, pay the whole of the unpaid principal with
