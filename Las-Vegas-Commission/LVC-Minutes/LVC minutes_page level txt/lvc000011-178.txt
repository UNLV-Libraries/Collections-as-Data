Modification of Lease	lease agreement with James Cashman Company on the rental of cars for the Police

Department for this fiscal year. Mr. Kennedy stated that the first change is in
paragraph 2, wherein the City is required to carry public liability, fire, theft
and accident insurance to protect both parties against loss and injury. He further 
stated that instead that instead of this clause, teh City will carry deductible 
insurance and collision insurance, and agrees to reimburse the owner on
repairs to cars. The City Manager reported that the second change is in the
change of name of the lessor from James Cashman Company to J.C. Investment Company.

Mr. Kennedy advised that these modifications have been submitted in agreement form
by the City Attorney, and agreed to by the Cashman Company.

TOWN & COUNTRY	The City Manager reported that a letter has been received from the owners of the

SHOPPING CENTER	property on East Charleston Boulevard, asking for release of the bond posted by

Bond Release	William Peccole, Peter Piccoli, Don Atkin and C.L. Martin on the proposed Town and

Country Shopping Center.

Mr. Kennedy advised that this bond had been released by Commission action of March
26, 1958, subject to the dedication and installation of paving, curbs and gutter,
of an additional thirty (30) feet on Burnham Avenue. The City Manager stated that
the owners of this property are requesting that a complete release be made, and
explained that negotiations are being made to install a first class shopping center.
Mr. Kennedy further reported that the owners feel that to dedicate and install the
necessary improvements on Burnham Road at this time, would be a waste of money since
they do not know exactly where the points of ingress and egress will be required;
and the owners will sign any agreement or contract necessary that such improvements
will be established, at the time the proposed new shopping center is finalized.
