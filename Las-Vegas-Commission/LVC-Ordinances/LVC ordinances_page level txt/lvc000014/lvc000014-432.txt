Section 1. Section 7 of Ordinance No. 244 of the City of Las Vegas, also referred to as Section 10,
Chapter 17, of the Las Vegas City Code, is hereby amended to read as follows:

Every person, firm, association, or corporation engaged in the telephone business, or in the business
of furnishing and supplying heating or illuminating gas to others through gas mains, or electrical current for
power, lighting, or domestic purposes, or who supplies water for domestic purposes to others through water
mains, shall pay for and obtain a quarterly license to carry on each of such businesses, as per the schedule
hereinafter recited in this section.

Every telephone company shall pay for such license a sum equal
to three-fourths (3/4ths) of one percent (1%) of its gross
quarterly earnings.

Every gas company shall pay for such license a sum equal to
three-fourths (3/4ths) of one percent (1%) of its gross quar-
terly earnings.

Every water company shall pay for such license a sum equal to
three-fourths (3/4ths) of one percent (1%) of its gross quar-
terly earnings.

Every electric light or power company shall pay a sum equal to
one percent (1%) of its gross quarterly earnings.

Prior to the issuance of a license hereunder, the applicant therefor shall state in writing, under
oath, to the City Clerk, the probable amount of gross earnings which it is estimated will be made in the ensu-
ing period for which the license is to be issued, and when the applicant has held a license for the next pre-
ceding period, the estimate shall be computed upon the amount of gross earnings made during such preceding
period. Where the amount of gross earnings actually made in any period shall be in excess of the estimate
for such period, the licensee shall be indebted to the City for any deficiency in fee paid for such period and
liable therefor to the City in a civil action. No license hereunder shall be issued to such licensee for any
subsequent period unless and until such deficiency is paid to the City Clerk, and when so paid, shall consti-
tute an additional fee for any license issued hereunder for such subsequent period, and be deemed in full pay-
ment of such deficiency. Where the amount of gross earnings actually made in any period shall be less than the
estimate for such period, the excess paid in the previous period shall be credited to the licensee and the same
shall be applied to a license issued to such licensee for the subsequent period.

This provision shall apply to all persons conducting the above mentioned business or any of them,
whether under permission and regulation of the Public Service Commission in the State of Nevada or otherwise.

This section shall not apply to water companies having monthly gross sales of less than $3,000, which
companies shall pay tax under Section 6 of Ordinance #244, also referred to as Section 9, Chapter 17 of the
Las Vegas Code.

shall not be affected thereby.

Section 4. This ordinance shall be in full force and effect upon its publication as in the next sec-
tion provided, and final passage.
