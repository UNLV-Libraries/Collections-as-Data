personal, subject to taxation within the boundaries of said City, including the net proceeds of mines, a tax
sufficient to reimburse said fund or funds for such installments of interest and principal, and for the pur-
pose of creating a fund for the payment of said bonds and the interest thereon, there shall be levied in the
year 1949 and annually thereafter, a sufficient tax on all property, both real and personal, subject to taxa-
tion within the boundaries of the City of Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada, including the net proceeds of mines,
sufficient to pay the interest on said bonds and to pay and retire the same as hereinabove provided; and pro-
vided further that in the preparation of the annual appropriation ordinance for the City, the Board of City
Commissioners shall first make proper provision, through the levy of sufficient taxes, for the payment of the
interest on and the retirement of the principal of the bonded indebtedness of the City, and the amount of
money necessary for this purpose, together with the amounts necessary for the payment of principal of and
interest on the other bonded indebtedness of the City, shall be a first charge against all of the revenue
received by said City. In any year in which the total taxes levied by all overlapping political subdivisions
and taxing units in Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada, may exceed the limitation of five cents on the dollar
imposed by Section 2 of Article X of the Constitution of the State of Nevada, and it shall become necessary
by reason thereof to reduce the levies made in behalf of said City, the reductions so made shall be in taxes
levied for or by such City for purposes other than the payment of its bonded indebtedness and interest thereon,
and the taxes levied hereafter for the payment of such bonded indebtedness, and the interest thereon, shall
always enjoy a priority over taxes levied for or on behalf of such City for any other purposes where reduction
is necessary in order to comply with the limitations of said Section 2 of Article X of the Nevada constitu-
tion, or with the City Charter of Las Vegas, Nevada. Such tax shall be levied and collected in the same manner
and at the same time as other taxes are levied and collected, and the proceeds thereof shall be kept by the
County Treasurer in a special fund to be known as the "Sewage Disposal Bond Series of May 1, 1948, Fund",
which shall be used for no other purpose than	the payment	of	principal and interest as the	same fall due.

Such tax shall be levied in the year 1949 and	annually thereafter until	all of said bonds,	and the interest

thereon, shall have been fully paid, satisfied and discharged. Any sums coming due on said bonds at any time
when there are on hand from such tax levy or levies, insufficient funds to pay the same, shall be promptly
paid when due from general funds on hand belonging to the City of Las Vegas, reimbursement to be made to such
general funds in the sums thus advanced when taxes herein provided for shall have been collected.

Section 4. That nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to prevent the City of Las Vegas
from applying to the payment of the bonds authorized to be issued under Emergency Ordinance No. 353 duly
adopted by the Board of City Commissioners on the 23rd day of April, 1948, as amended and supplemented, any
funds available for that purpose, including the net revenues derived from the imposition of rates, fees and
charges for the use of the sewage disposal system in accordance with the provisions of Ordinance No. 364 duly
adopted by the Board of City Commissioners on	the 7th day	of	September,	1948, it being the	intention hereof

that the holder or holders from time to time of the bonds	so	authorized	to be issued shall	have the benefit

of all the covenants contained in this ordinance and in said Emergency Ordinance No. 353 and said Ordinance
No. 364.

Section 5. This ordinance shall be and become effective immediately after its adoption, approval
and the publication thereof for two consecutive weeks in the Las Vegas Evening Review-Journal, a daily news-
paper published in the City of Las Vegas for a period of once a week for a period of two weeks, immediately
after its final passage and approval at this meeting.

ADOPTED AND APPROVED this 10th day of November, A. D. 1948.
