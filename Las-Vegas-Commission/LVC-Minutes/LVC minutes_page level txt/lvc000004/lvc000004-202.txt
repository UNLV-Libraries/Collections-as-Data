The matter of meeting more than the two meetings a month as set by ordinance was discussed
by the Board. Mayor Russell was of the opinion that two meetings per month were sufficient and that
by holding meetings only on these dates, namely the 4th and 16th of each month, the public would
be advised of the time of meetings and could attend same. Commissioner Ronnow stated that the
date of all meetings (recessed) were stated before a meeting recessed and that the press gave the
time of meeting considerable publicity and therefore it was not necessary to hold to two meetings
each month. After some discussion on this matter on motion of Commissioner Ronnow it was moved and
carried that this meeting recess to meet the night of June 27th, 1939 at the hour of seven thirty
P.M. Seconded by Commissioner Corradetti.

Vote Commissioners Ronnow, Gilbert, Krause and Corradetti voting aye. His Honor the Mayor
