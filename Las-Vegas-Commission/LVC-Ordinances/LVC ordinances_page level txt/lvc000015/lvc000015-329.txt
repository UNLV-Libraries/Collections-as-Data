The City of Las Vegas, in the County of Clark and State of Nevada, a municipal corporation duly organized
and existing, for value received hereby promises, out of funds available for the purpose, as hereinafter
set forth, to pay to bearer hereof the principal sum of

ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS

SIX HUNDRED FORTY SIX AND SIXTY SEVEN ONE HUNDREDTHS DOLLARS

on the first day of July, 1955, with interest thereon until maturity according to interest coupons hereto
attached, and thereafter until paid at the rate of Four and Forty One Hundredths per centum (4.40%)
per annum, payable annually on the first day of July in each year, both principal and interest being
payable in lawful money of the United States of America, at the office of the City Treasurer, City of
Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada, upon presentation and surrender of this bond and of the annexed
coupons as they severally become due.

This bond is subject to redemption at the option of the City of Las Vegas on any interest payment date
at a price equal to the principal amount thereof with accrued interest to the redemption date. Redemption
shall be made upon not less than 15 days' prior notice by publication in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City of Las Vegas in the manner and upon the conditions provided in the ordinance
authorizing the issuance of this bond.

This bond is one of a series of 170 special assessment, negotiable coupons, improvement bonds, numbered
consecutively from one to one-hundred seventy, both inclusive issued by the City of Las Vegas, all of
which are of like date and designation and aggregate the total amount of One-Hundred Sixty Two
Thousand, Four-Hundred Forty-Six and Sixty Seven One-Hundredths Dollars ($162.446.67).

This bond and the interest thereon shall be payable from a special fund designated "Street Improvement
Assessment District No. 100-25 Bond Interest and Redemption Fund," containing the receipts upon the
collection thereof from the special assessments levied against and secured by a lien upon property
in Street Improvement Assessment District No. 100-25, which fund is and shall continue to constitute
a sinking fund for and be deemed specially appropriated to the full and prompt payment of said bonds and
the interest thereon, and shall be used for no other purpose whatever, provided, however, that in the
event said fund shall be insufficient to pay said bonds and the interest thereon as they became due, the
deficiency shall be paid out of the City's general fund.

Said special assessments made and levied to defray said cost, with accruing interest thereon, constitute
a lien upon and against the property upon which such assessments were made and levied from and after
the 10th day of May, 1954, the date upon which the assessment roll therefor was confirmed and approved
by the Board of Commissioners of said City.

It is hereby certified, recited and declared that all acts, conditions and things essential to the
validity of the bond exist, have happened and have been done in due time, form and manner as required by
law, and that the total issue of said improvement bonds of said City for said improvements and
incidental expenses, including this bond, does not exceed the amount authorized by law nor the special
assessments levied to cover the cost of said improvements.

It is hereby further certified, recited and declared that the proceedings, with reference to making
such improvements and levying the assessments to pay therefor, have been regularly had and taken in
compliance with law, and that all prerequisites to the fixing of the assessment lien against the
property benefited by the improvements and of the personal liability of the owner or owners of such
property therefor have been performed.

This bond is subject to the condition, and every holder hereof by accepting the same agrees with the
obligor and every subsequent holder hereof, that (a) the delivery of this bond to any transferee shall
vest title in this bond and in the interest coupons attached hereto in such transferee to the same
extent for all purposes as would the delivery under like circumstances of any negotiable instrument
payable to bearer; (b) the obligor and any agent of the obligor may treat the bearer of this bond as the
absolute owner hereof for all purposes, and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary; (c) the
principal of and the interest on this bond shall be paid, and this bond and each of the coupons appertain-
ing thereto are transferable, free from and without regard to any equities between the obligor and the
original of any intermediate holder hereof, or any set-offs or cross-claims; and (d) the surrender to
the obligor or any agent of the obligor of this bond and each of the coupons shall be a good discharge to
the obligor for the same.
