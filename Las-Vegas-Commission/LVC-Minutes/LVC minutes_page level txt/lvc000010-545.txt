testing the possibility of using this type of equipment for decontamination in
connection with atomic bombs. Mr. Kennedy explained that the testing will be done
at the Atomic Energy Commission's Nevada Test Bite, and the crew for the truck will
be composed of the Fire Chiefs of San Diego, San Bernardino, Los Angeles County,
with Fire Chief Elmer Gates driver of the truck. The Manager also advised the
Commission that an insurance policy would be filed with the City to cover this
equipment during the period it is on loan by the City, and that the truck would be
needed sometime after the 7th of August, 1957. Mr. Kennedy recommended this re-
quest be granted, subject to clearance from the City Attorney as to the legality
of loaning the equipment.

Commissioner Fountain moved this recommendation be accepted and the request of
the Civilian Defense for the loan of a fire truck from the City be approved,
subject to clearance by the City Attorney.

sioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent:
