His Honor Mayor Baker explained that if there were specific problems that they should
have them ready to present and the Board would be glad to meet on it. He stated that
he deplored these criticisms without specific instances.

Mr. Carter again spoke to the Board stating that it is their responsibility to secure
as much work for their employees as they can.

His Honor Mayor Baker stated that he thought it is the desire of the Board to make
available as much work as possible and stay out of the private construction business.

He stated there may have been infractions but he did not believe it is as serious
as they might think and he was sure it could be explained.

Mr. Jim Arnold, Secretary, Southern Nevada Building and Trades Councils, addressed
	the Board and said that they would certainly appreciate appearing before them with

actual facts and see if some of the difficulties could be ironed out.

Mayor Baker suggested that they contact City Manager Kennedy about a time for a
meeting.

Commissioner Bunker asked if the same request is going to be made of the County.

Mayor Baker added "and with other Cities of the County and the State of Nevada and
other quasi-governmental agencies."



There being no further business to come before the Board, at the hour of 10:20 P.M.
Commissioner Bunker moved this meeting adjourn.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote: Commissioners
Bunker, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none. Absent:	Commissioner
