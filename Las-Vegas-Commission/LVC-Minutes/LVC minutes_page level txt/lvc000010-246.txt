The City of Las Vegas; in the County of Clark and State of Nevada, a

promises, out of funds available for the purpose, as hereinafter set forth, to
pay to bearer hereof the principal sum of

ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS

EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE AND TWENTY THREE ONE HUNDREDTHS DOLLARS

on the first day of April, 1957; with interest thereon until maturity according to
the interest coupons hereto attached, and thereafter until paid at the rate of three
and three-fourths per centum (3-3/4%) per annum, payable annually on the first day
of April in each year, both principal and interest being payable in lawful money of
the United State of America, at the office of the City Treasurer, City of Las Vegas,
Clark County, Nevada, upon presentation and surrender of this bond and of the annexed
coupons as they severally become due.

This bond is subject to redemption at the option of the City of Las Vegas
on any interest payment date at a price equal to the principal amount thereof with
accrued interest to the redemption date. Redemption shall be made upon not less than
fifteen days' prior notice by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in
the City of Las Vegas in the manner and upon the conditions provided in the ordi-
nance authorizing the issuance of this bond.

This bond is one of a series of 580 special assessment, negotiable coupon,
improvement bonds, numbered consecutively from one to 580, both inclusive, issued
by the City of Las Vegas, all of which are of like date and designation and aggregate
the total amount of Five Hundred Seventy Seven Thousand One Hundred Forty Five and
Twenty Three One Hundredths Dollars ($577,145.23).

This bond and the interest thereon shall be payable from a special fund
designated "Street Improvement Assessment District No. 100-36 Bond Interest and
Redemption Fund," containing the receipts upon the collection thereof from the
special assessments levied against and secured by a lien upon property in Street
Improvement Assessment District No. 100-36, which fund is and shall continue to
constitute a sinking fund for and be deemed specially appropriated to the full and
prompt payment of said bonds and the interest thereon, and shall be used for no
other purpose whatever, provided, however, that in the event said fund shall be
insufficient to pay said bonds and the interest thereon as they became due, the
deficiency shall be paid out of the City's general fund.

Said special assessments made and levied to defray said cost, with
accruing interest thereon, constitute a lien upon and against the property upon
which such assessments were made and levied from and after the 15th day of February,
1956 the date upon which the amended assessment roll therefor was confirmed and ap-
proved by the Board of Commissioners of said City.

It is hereby certified, recited and declared that all acts, conditions
and things essential to the validity of the bond exist, have happened and have been
done in due time, form and manner as required by law, and that the total issue of
said improvement bonds of said City for said improvements and incidental expenses,
including this bond, does not exceed the amount authorized by law nor the special
assessments levied to cover the cost of said improvements.

It is hereby further certified, recited and declared that the proceedings,
with reference to making such improvements and levying the assessments to pay there-
for, have been regularly had and taken in compliance with law, and that all prere-
quisites to the fixing of the assessment lien against the property benefited by the
improvements and of the personal liability of the owner or owners of such property
therefor have been performed.

This bond is subject to the condition, and every holder thereof by accepting
the same agrees with obligor and every subsequent holder hereof, that (a) the delivery
of this bond to the transferee shall vest title in this bond and in the interest cou-
pons attached hereto in such transferee to the same extent for all purposes as would
the delivery under like circumstances of any negotiable instrument payable to bearer;
