AN ORDINANCE AMENDING CHAPTER 17 OF THE CODE OF LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, 1949, WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE
LICENSING OF BUSINESSES WITHIN THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS, BY ADDING A NEW SECTION THERETO TO BE KNOWN
AS SECTION 23; LIMITING THE LOCATION OF COIN OPERATED AMUSEMENT MACHINES: PROHIBITING PERSONS UNDER
18 FROM PLAYING CERTAIN MACHINES; PROVIDING OTHER MATTERS PROPERLY RELATED THERETO; PROVIDING
PENALTIES FOR THE VIOLATION HEREOF.

WHEREAS, it has come to the attention of the Board of Commissioners that coin operated amusement
machines have been licensed and operating in close proximity to public schools; and

WHEREAS, the location of these machines in places of business in such close proximity to
schools is contrary to the public morals and welfare of the City of Las Vegas and tends to corrupt
the welfare and morals of students at said schools and churches; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners feel that it is in the public interest and for the promo-
tion of the general welfare of the people of the City of Las Vegas that the location of these
machines be limited to locations away from said schools and churches; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has determined that it is in the public interest to
restrict the playing of coin operated plunger type amusement machines or so-called pinball machines,
to persons over the age of 18 for the reason that such type of machines encourage gambling in
that no value is received therefrom,

NOW THEREFORE, the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas do ordain as follows:

SECTION 1. Chapter 17, Code of Las Vegas, Nevada, 1949, is hereby amended by adding there-
to a new section to be known as Section 23 which shall read as follows:

SECTION 23. a) No license for coin operated amusement machines, as defined in this chapter,
shall be issued to any establishment located within 500 feet of a public
or private school, or church.

b)	No person under the age of eighteen (18) years shall be permitted to play

a coin operated plunger type amusement machine or so-called pinball machine,
and any licensee who shall permit any person under the age of 18 to play a
coin operated plunger type amusement machine or so so-called pinball
machine held under such license, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

c)	Any person under 18 playing a coin operated plunger type amusement machine
or so-called pinball machine, shall constitute prima facie evidence of the
fact that such machine is played with the permission, knowledge and consent
of the holder of the license therefor.

d)	The playing of a coin operated plunger type amusement machine or so-called
pinball machine, by any person under 18 years of age shall constitute
sufficient grounds for the immediate revocation of the license issued

to any person for the coin operated plunger type amusement machine or so-
called pinball machine so played and all other licenses for similar types
of machines held by such operator.

e)	Any license heretofore issued for the operation of coin operated amusement
machines, may be revoked without notice if such license is issued to a place
of business within 500 feet of any school or church.

SECTION 2. Any violation of this ordinance, or any provision herein contained shall con-
stitute a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not to exceed
Five Hundred ($500.00) Dollars, and/or six (6) months in the City Jail, or a combination of both.

SECTION 3. All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are hereby repealed.

SECTION 4. That the City Clerk and Clerk of the Board of Commissioners of the City of
Las Vegas shall cause this ordinance to be published once a week for two successive weeks immediately
following its final reading and adoption, in the Las Vegas Review Journal, a daily newspaper
