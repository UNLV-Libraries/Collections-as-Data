At this time the request to move a house from 518 Bridger and 230 South 6th Street
to Lots 5, 6, 7, Block 6, Wardie Addition and 300 Block South 6th Street was considered.

On Commissioner Sharp's recommendation the Board decided to inform the neighboring
people of this proposed house moving and to hold a Public Hearing on November 3, 1954.

At this time the request to move a house from 1300 Orangewood Drive to approximately
1600 feet south of Ashby Avenue and 1300 feet west of Rancho Drive was considered.

Commissioner Jarrett moved that this request be denied due to the fact that a house
cannot be moved on an undedicated street.

Bunker, Jarrett, Sharp, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.
