(CALL OF SPECIAL MEETING)

A special meeting of the Board of Commissioners of the City of

Las Vegas, Nevada, held this 29th day of December, 1959, was called

to order at the hour of 4:00 P.M., with the following members present:

SECTION 361.340 N.R.S. PROVIDES THAT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION OF
EACH COUNTY SHALL CONSIST OF THREE (3) MEMBERS OF BOARD OF COUNTY
COMMISSIONERS; ONE (l) MEMBER REPRESENTING THE COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT;

AND ONE MEMBER REPRESENTING INCORPORATED CITIES IN COUNTY TO BE
SELECTED FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE BOARDS AND SHALL BE APPOINTED BY
RESPECTIVE CITY COUNCILS IN JOINT ACTION.

At the scheduled hour of 4:00 P.M all representatives of the several-
municipal governments were present, except one from Boulder City.

Mayor Gragson raised the question whether it would be legal to select
a representative to act on the Board of Equalization since the
Boulder City representative did not appear.

A. H. Kennedy, City Manager, stated he was of the opinion that since
Boulder City would not actually become a municipality until January
4, 1960, and the law provides that the Board of Equalization convene
on the same date, it would appear that those present could select a
representative to the Board.

Mayor Gragson opened the meeting at 4:15 P.M. and asked for some
discussion before calling for a motion.

Mayor Hartke, North Las Vegas, spoke as follows:	"I would like to

refer back to two years ago - at that time I was selected to represent
the three cities, which I did. The then Mayor of Las Vegas, C. D. Baker,
