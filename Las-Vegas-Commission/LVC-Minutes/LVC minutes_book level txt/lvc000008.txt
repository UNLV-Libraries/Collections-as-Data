#287	EMERGENCY RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, the Budget of the City of Las Vegas for the year 1952 provides for the sum
of TWO HUNDRED FORTY TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTEEN AND SEVENTY-HUNDREDTHS DOLLARS
($242,471.70), for Police Department salaries; and

WHEREAS, the Budget of the City of Las Vegas for the year 1952 provides for a capi-
tal outlay of THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY SIX AND NINETY HUNDREDTHS DOLLARS ($3,856.90),
for the Sewer Maintenance Department; and

WHEREAS, said Budget for the year 1952 was approved by the State Board of Finance
of the State of Nevada; and

WHEREAS, by reason of the large increase in the population of the City of Las Vegas,
the present personnel of the Police Department is inadequate to properly provide for the
public peace, welfare and safety; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners feel that it is absolutely necessary to immediately
employ ten (10) additional police officers; and

WHEREAS, the salaries of such additional police officers will amount to TWENTY
THOUSAND DOLLARS ($20,000.00) during the year of 1952; and

WHEREAS, such need for additional police protection was not foreseen at the time the
budget was prepared although due care and consideration was given; and

WHEREAS, a need for additional repairs to the Sewer Plant of the City of Las Vegas
has arisen due to the necessity of replacing old lines to the said Sewer Plant; and

WHEREAS, the need for such installations was not foreseen at the time the budget for
the year 1952 was prepared although due care and consideration was given; and

WHEREAS, by reason of the foregoing, a great necessity and emergency exists in con-
nection with the continued governmental operations of the City of Las Vegas, requiring the
immediate acquisition of the sum of TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLIARS ($25,000.00), to defray the
costs of such increase in personnel of the Police Department and the installation of new
lines for the Sewer Maintenance Department; and

WHEREAS, this additional sum of TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($25,000.00), can be
obtained by a transfer from the Capital Outlay Item of the sum of $20,000.00 (TWENTY THOUSAND
DOLLARS), to the Police Salaries Item, and by the transfer from the Capital Outlay Item of the
sum of FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS, ($5,000.00), to the Sewer Maintenance Department; and

WHEREAS, it is the Judgment of the Board of City Commissioners of the City of Las
Vegas that such transfers can be made without impairment of the fiscal affairs of the City
since there is sufficient money in the Capital Outlay Fund; and

WHEREAS, it will not be necessary to levy an emergency tax in the ordinary course
of events,

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS,
pursuant to an Act of the Legislature of the State of Nevada entitled "An Act regulating the
fiscal management of counties, cities, towns, school districts, and other governmental agen-
cies," approved March 22, 1917, as amended that a transfer of TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($20,000.
from the Capital Outlay Fund to Police Salaries Fund, and a transfer of FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS
($5,000.00), from the Capital Outlay Fund to Sewer Maintenance Capital Outlay, be and the
same is hereby authorized for the purpose of meeting the necessity and emergency aforesaid;
and

ected to immediately forward a certified copy of this Emergency Resolution to the State
Board of Finance at Carson City, Nevada, for its approval, as required by the Act aforesaid.

to be facts and therefore moves that the application of Paradise Groves Inc. for rezoning
of Lots 1 to 43 of the proposed Paradise Groves Subdivision from R-l to R-2 be approved:

1,	The development of all areas available with utilities for expansion
with least interference to existing improvements is an immediate
need and constitutes a present emergency.

2.	There is an unliklihood of any development in this area without rezoning,
due to inability for financing R-l next to commercial zoning.

3.	The same type of construction now proposed exists adjacent to the
commercial zone, south of Oakey Boulevard with similar street alignments
and improvements, and constitutes an area in which neither this Board
nor the Public has had any complaints.

4. The development of adjacent areas will be helped rather than hindered
or damaged by approval of this tract.

5. The new plat of adjacent property will provide an adequate system of

connecting streets to main business, school and church sites, and through
arteries.

6. The plan follows principles of good planning within out capacity to realize
at this time.

trict for the installation of sidewalks, street lights, curbs and gutters, and pave-
ment. Mr. Brown stated that he thought the property owners would be willing to

and the whole amount of the unpaid principal and accrued interest shall thereafter
bear penalty at the rate of ten per centum per annum, until the day of sale, but
at any time prior to the day of the sale, the owner may pay the amount of all un-
paid installments, with interest thereon at ten per centum per annum, and all
penalties accrued, and shall thereupon be restored to the right thereafter to pay
in installments in the same manner as if default had not been suffered. The owner

interest paying date.

payment for the improvements for which said assessments were made, and shall not
be used for any other purpose until said bonds and the interest thereon is fully
paid.

shall state therein when and where said assessment is due and payable.

Bunker, Jarrett, Pecoole, Whipple and His Honor voting aye; noes, none.

The Mayor announced that this was the time and place designated for the Board of
Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, to meet and hear and consider any
suggestions and objections that may be made by parties in interest to the proposed
improvements, or any matters relating thereto, in the proposed Street Improvement
Assessment District No. 100-19 in said City as provided in Emergency Ordinance No.

535, passed, adopted and approved the 25th day of Marcel, 1953, and the notice prescribed
therein. The Mayor then asked if any written objections, suggestions or comments
concerning said District had been filed in the office of the City Clerk. The City
Clerk answered that no objections, suggestions or comments concerning said District
had been filed in her office prior to said meeting, and she filed a certificate with
the Board of Commissioners to that effect.

The Mayor then publicly asked if anyone desired to make any objection suggestion or
comment, or raise any question, concerning said District.

Mr. Cleveland Schultz, Jr., owner of property on the corner of 8th and Stewart Streets
appeared before the Board to protest the repaving of Stewart Avenue. It was explained
to Mr. Schultz and other property owners in this area, that the proposed improvements
were not to be a complete paving project, but merely seal coat and chips over the
existing pavement. Thereafter, they withdrew their objections to the proposed improvements.

Commissioner Jarrett introduced and moved the adoption of the following emergency ordinance,
which was thereupon read in full, and at length, and is as follows:

per annum, until the day of sale, but at any time prior to the day of the sale, the owner may
pay the amount of all unpaid installments, with interest thereon at ten per centum per annum,
and all penalties accrued, and shall thereupon be restored to the right thereafter to pay in in-
stallments in the same manner as if default had not been suffered. The owner of any property not

collected.

Section 16. That the special assessments, both principal and interest, when collected,
shall be placed in a special fund to be known as "Sanitary Sewer Improvement Assessment District

be hereafter authorized, sold, issued and delivered for the purpose of paying in part the cost
or expense of said improvements; and said fund shall be applied to payment for the improvements

City Treasurer immediately shall notify each person known to said Ex-Officio City Assessor, whose
name appears on said assessment roll, by United States of America mail, that an assessment has
been levied against said person and the designated property in said Sanitary Sewer Improvement
Assessment District No. 200-12, and shall state therein when and where said assessment is due and
payable.

Section 18. That all action (Not inconsistent with the provisions of this ordinance) hereto-
fore taken by the City of Las Vegas, and the officers of said City, directed toward the making
of said improvements by installing a sanitary sewer along certain streets and portions of streets
and easements therein in said Sanitary Sewer Improvement Assessment District No. 200-12, toward

shall, for any reason, be questioned or held invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair or
invalidate the remaining provisions of this ordinance, but shall be confined in its operation to
the specific sections, sentences, clauses or parts of this ordinance so held unconstitutional and
invalid, and the inapplicability and invalidity of any section, sentence, clause or part of this
ordinance, in any one or more instances shall not affect or prejudice in any way the applicability
and validity of this ordinance in any other instances.

inadequate to meet the present and future needs of the City and its inhabitants and that it is
necessary immediately to raise funds to extend said sewer system, therefore, it is hereby de-
clared that an emergency exists, and that this ordinance is necessary for the immediate preser-
vation of the public peace, health and safety.

(c)	Revenue stamps on deed to be paid for by Seller;

This proposal intends that the above purchase price of $255,000*00 shall be net to

and in connection with the escrow covering the transaction, there being no other
fees or commissions involved.

The Buyer agrees that if this offer is accepted, together with the enclosed check

To purchase the property owned by the City of Las Vegas located on U.S. Highway #91,
south of Las Vegas, Nevada, and commonly known as and referred to as the City of Las

comprises approximately 50.00 acres, to line of proposed truck highway, for the sum
of $275,000,00, payable in cash as follows:

7-22-53 & 7-23-53
The proposed escrow should be set up subject to the following terras and conditions:

(a) At the close thereof, the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer a good and sufficient
Grant Deed to said property, and also a policy of title insurance showing such property
to be free and clear of any and all liens and encumbrances; and vesting clear title to
said property in Buyer;

(c)	Revenue Stamps on deed to be paid for by Seller;

This proposal intends that the above purchase price of $275,000.00 shall be net

forth in connection with the escrow covering the transaction, there being no other
fees or commissions involved.

The undersigned agrees that if this offer is accepted, together with the enclosed

signed fails to make either or both of the subsequent payments of $100,000.00 and
$147.500.00 as stated above in such event, the undersigned agrees to forfeit to the City
of Las Vegas, any and all sums paid in this connection prior to his default in payment,
as liquidated, damages.

Titles may be taken in the name of a Nevada Corporation to be designated by Buyer or
a Nominee.

Thereafter Commissioner Whipple moved the above proposal be accepted.

This motion died for lack of second.

Commissioner Bunker stated that he felt the above proposal was fair one and equitable
one and that he would be willing to accept if the City had originally advertised for
bids with the Truck Highway included in such advertisement. He felt the Commission
would be subject to criticism by the Public if they accepted the above and had not
given notice that the Truck Highway would be included.

No action was taken on this matter.

There being no further business to come before the Board at this recessed special
meeting the meeting adjourned.

the real estate brokers have been informed. Mr. Whipple stated that he had talked to two

center and off-street parking. He stated that he thought that the youths need the expanded facilities

in this community.

should be spent for a youth center.

Commissioner Sharp moved that Raymond Carey be appointed City Manager at a salary of
$12,000 per year, effective September 1, 1953.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Jarrett and carried by the following vote:

Commissioner Bunker voted "no” and stated that he cannot in good conscience vote for Mr.
Carey because he cannot see any justification at all for a starting salary of $12,000 in
view of previous experience. Mr. Carey’s reaction on the Commission investigating him
shows poor judgment and immature action. He cannot understand why Mr. Carey is leaving
a position of $14,000 to accept $12,000; however, if he receives the majority vote of the
Commission he will support Mr. Carey and give any assistance he can while he is a Commis-
sioner.

and collected in the same manner and at the same time as other taxes are levied and collected, and the
proceeds thereof shall be kept by the County Treasurer in said special fund, designated "Las Vegas
General Obligation Sewer Bond Fund, Series September 1, 1953," which shall be used for no other
purpose than the payment of principal and interest as the same falls due. Such taxes shall be levied
in the year 1953 and annually thereafter until all of said bonds and the interest thereon shall have
been fully paid, satisfied, and discharged. Any sums coming due on said bonds at any time when
there are on hand, from such tax levy or levies, insufficient funds to pay the same, shall be promptly
paid when due from general funds on hand belonging to the City of Las Vegas, reimbursement to be
made for such general funds in the amounts so advanced when the taxes herein provided for have been
collected.

Section 8. That it shall be the duty of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Las Vegas,

shall be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this ordinance, to ratify and carry out the
provisions hereof with reference to the levy and collection of taxes, and said Board shall require

acquired and established out of the proceeds of the sale of said bonds shall and will be in excess of twenty-
five years from their date.

Section 10. That the officers of the City of Las Vegas be, and they hereby are, authorized and directed

municipal officials, the assessed valuation and indebtedness of the City of Las Vegas, the rate of taxes
levied against the taxable property within the City of Las Vegas, the receipt of the bond purchase price, and,
if in accordance with the facts, the absence of litigation, pending or threatened, affecting the validity
thereof.

Section 11. That all by laws, orders, resolutions, and ordinances, or parts of by laws, orders,
resolutions, and ordinances in conflict with this ordinance, are hereby repealed. After the bonds hereby
authorized have been issued, this ordinance shall constitute a contract between said City and the holder
or holders of said bonds, and shall be and remain irrepealable until said bonds and the interest accruing
thereon shall have been fully paid, satisfied and discharged.

Section 12. That if any one or more sections, sentences, clauses or parts of this ordinance shall, for any
reason, be questioned or be held invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remaining
provisions of this ordinance, but shall be confined in its operation to the specific sections, sentences, clauses
or parts of this ordinance so held unconstitutional and invalid, and the inapplicability and invalidity of any
section, sentence, clause, or part of this ordinance, in any one or more instances shall not affect or prejudice
in any way the applicability and validity of this ordinance in any other instances.

is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, helath and safety.
