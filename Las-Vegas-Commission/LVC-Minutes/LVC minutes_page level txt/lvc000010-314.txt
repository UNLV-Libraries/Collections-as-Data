PURCHASE OF PROPERTY 	City Manager Kennedy gave a report on the financial condition of the City and advised the
2nd & Mesquite	Commission that there was sufficient money on hand to take advantage of the offer of the

	Fremont Hotel, Inc. to purchase their equity in the property located on the southwest

corner of North 2nd and Mesquite, if the Commission so desires. Mr. Kennedy further re-
ported the surplus of anticipated funds was mainly due to the savings by department heads
in the operation of their individual departments.

Commissioner Bunker asked if there wasn't a decrease in the amount of revenue the City is
receiving in permit fees.

City Manager Kennedy answered that perhaps there are less permits being written in these
departments, but the average amount of fees collected is the same.
