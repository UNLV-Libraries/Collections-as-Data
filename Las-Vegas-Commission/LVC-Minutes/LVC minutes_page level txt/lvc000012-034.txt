Commissioners Elwell, Fountain, Sharp and. His Honor, Mayor Gragson,
voting aye; noes, none. Absent:	Commissioner Whipple.

Director of Public Works Sauer stated the plans, specifications and
estimate of cost for street lighting between 6th Street and East
Charleston Boulevard on Fremont, and proposed widening from 7th Street
to 14th Street on Fremont have been filed with the City Clerk.

Department of Public Works recommended that an Emergency Ordinance,
creating an Assessment District and providing for a public hearing be
prepared.

Commissioner Fountain inquired what percentage of the property owners
were in favor of the Assessment District. Director of Public Works
Sauer advised that of the 86 property owners, 51.1% were in favor of
the Assessment District, 10.5% were opposed, and 38.4% gave no reply;
on the basis of front footage, 54.9% were in favor, 12.4% opposed, and
32.7% gave no reply. Mr. Sauer went on to say that at the time the
Assessment District was first established it went from Charleston
Boulevard to 6th Street on Fremont; however, the property owners
between 6th and 7th Streets have no desire to be included in the
Assessment District, and following the Public Hearing, which would be
the next stop in the creation of this Assessment District, the Commission
has authority to reduce the district from 7th Street to Charleston
Boulevard for lighting, and from 7th to 14th Streets for widening.
