Mr. Cal Cory, representing the Fremont Drug Store, was present to protest the prohibi-
tion of the sale of half pints in package liquor licenses in Grocery Stores and Drug
Stores.

Mr. John Kelly, secretary of the Clark County Licensed Beverage Association was also
present.

Mr. Harvy Parvin, one of the owners of the Fremont Drug also protested the prohibition of
drug stores that have package liquor licenses from the sale of half pints.

Thereafter the Commissions, requested that those protesting this section of the Ordinance
to meet with the other members of the Association and make a re port back to the City
Manager on the outcome by Friday, June 8, 1956 so that the ordinance can be published.

Mr. John Kelly also brought up for discussion the sale of draft beer by package liquor
stores, and requested that this be prohibited. He explained that the reason for this
was two-fold. Not only did the Tavern owners, who are paying a greater license fee,
object, but that by permitting such sale in package stores presented a difficult problem
wherein women cannot serve unless they are owners, and there are specific additional health
requirements that must be added to the place of business.

The Commission agreed to take this suggestion under advisement, and determined that they
would exclude the sale of draft beer from package liquor stores.

Commissioners Fountain and Sharp, committee for recommendation on the proposed amendment
to the Child Welfare Ordinance requested additional time so that the proposed ordinance
