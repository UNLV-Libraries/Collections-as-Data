On motion of Commissioner Marble seconded by Commissioner Krause it was moved and carried
that the reports of the committees of the Presidents birthday balls held in the years 1934-5-6
be spread upon the minutes of this meeting.

Said reports reading as follows:

January 27th, 1937

City of Las Vegas,

Las Vegas, Nevada.

Attention Mrs. Viola Burns.

Answering your letter under date of January 25th, will advise that all receipts from the
Birthday Ball held in 1934 were sent direct to committee in charge at New York City with the
exception	of	money expended	by local committee	for	hall rent,	orchestra and tickets. I Don't

seem to have	the exact amount sent from Las Vegas,	but it	you	so desire, will be glad to het

this information from General Committee to whom sent.

In 1935 our dance wasn't a very great success. They were holding a marathon dance in the
Elk's Hall and we held our dance in the Venetian Ball Room. Under the arrangements at that time
we mailed 30% of the net receipts to the General Committee and retained the balance here in add-
ition to a sum I believe in the neighborhood of $12.00 from telegrams sent. After holding this
money for sometime you will remember I appeared before the board and asked it they would have any
objection	if	this money was	turned over to the	Red	Cross and receiving permission from the Board

all money	left in this fund	was turned over to	Mr.	Yates, who was at that time in charge of Red

Cross in Las Vegas.

If the Board is desirous of knowing the exact amount realized from both of these dances, I
will be glad to write headquarters and get the necessary information.

Yours very Truly,

E.W. Cragin.
