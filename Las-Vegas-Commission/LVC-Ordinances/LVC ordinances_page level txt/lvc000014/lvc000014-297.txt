firmation and of the date thereof. The County Assessor, acting Ex-Officio City
Assessor, shall thereupon, without extra compensation, record such assessment

tribunals of the regularity of all proceedings preliminary to the making thereof,
and of the validity of the assessments and assessment roll. After the assessment roll

spaces formed by the intersection of streets shall be paid from the General Fund and
borne by the City of Las Vegas, and the balance of such expense shall be assessed upon
the taxable lots abutting upon such improvements and included in such special assessment
