Commissioner Fountain stated that there were two full pages of arrests, noting that on December
8, 1958 there were three arrests in one day and the same number on December 24, 1958, and many
more. Mrs. Elmore said that in many of those instances she called the police herself and at
other times she was not present. She requested another chance as everything she had was tied

see how Mrs. Elmore was going to control it. Commissioner Fountain added that there was too much
