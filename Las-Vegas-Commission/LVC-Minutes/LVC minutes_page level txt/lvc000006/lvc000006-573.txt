for loans	and	annual contributions, and undertake to develop and administer one or more Projects.

3.	Under the constitution and statutes of the State of Nevada, all Projects are exempt

to any Project, so long as either (a) such Project is used for low-rent housing purposes, or(b)
any contract between the Local Authority and the PHA for loans or annual contributions, or both,
in connection with such Project shall remain in force and effect, or (c) any bonds Issued in
connection with such Project shall remain outstanding, whichever period is the longest, the City
agrees that it will not levy or impose any real or personal property taxes upon such Project or
upon the Local Authority with respect thereto. During such period, the Local Authority shall make
annual payments (herein called Payments in Lieu of Taxes") in lieu of such taxes and in payment
for public services and facilities furnished for or with respect to such Project. Each such
annual Payment in Lieu of Taxes shall be made after the end of the fiscal year established for
such Project, and shall be in an amount equal to either (a) ten per cent (10%) of the aggregate
Shelter Rent charged by the Local Authority in respect to such Project during such fiscal year,

or (b) the amount permitted to be paid by applicable state law in effect on the date of this
