Mayor Baker announced that the purpose of this meeting was to hold a hearing
on whether or not the license issued to Donald Zak at 415 South 5th Street to
operate pinball machines should be revoked. His Honor asked for a report from
the City Manager.

Mr. Kennedy reported that on Thursday evening February l6th he received a call
calling attention to this arcade across from the 5th Street Grammar School.

On Friday morning he went to the arcade and found between thirty and forty
children, many of whom were playing the coin operated machines. He asked Mr.

Zak to see his license and was shewn a general mercantile license and a li-
cense to operate twenty coin operated machines. He then called the Police
photographer and had pictures taken, which he presented to the Commission.

Mayor Baker read a letter from Mr. Paul Arenaz, Chairman of the 5th Street
P.T.A. requesting that the Commission take action to close this establishment.

Mr. Zak and his attorney Calvin Magleby appeared at this time. Mr. Magleby
pointed out that Mr. Zak had applied for a license for an arcade which was
approved by the Police and Fire Departments. He stated that Mr. Zak had
signed a six month's lease for this location after his license had been ap-
proved, and if he were forced to close it would be a great financial burden.

Mr. Zak also spoke to the Commission and advised them that he checked closely
to see that the children crossed the street at the cross walks and that they
left his establishment at least five minutes before school started so that
they would not be late for class. He stated definitely that he did not
allow the children to smoke in his place.

Thereafter Commissioner Fountain moved that this Arcade is a definite nuisance
and directed that the license for Zak's Arcade be suspended until the proposed
ordinance abolishing coin operated machines within five hundred feet of schools
be adopted.

Motion seconded by Commissioner Whipple and carried by the following vote:	Com-

missioners Bunker, Fountain, Sharp, Whipple and Mayor Baker voting aye; noes, none.

The Commission instructed the Police Department to check other locations in the
City that have pinball machines and report back to the Commission.
