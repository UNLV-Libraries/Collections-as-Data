sideration of the allegations in the petition and any other competent evidence involving
the property in question and the other property in the vicinity thereof, that the facts
are such as to entitle the petitioner to an exception, the Commission shall grant the
petition excepting such property from any particular restriction or restrictions and permit
the erection, alteration, reconstruction or enlargement of any building or structure thereon

said governing body by filing with the clerk of said governing body a written notice of
such appeal.

If upon receiving such notice of appeal the governing body deems it necessary or ex-
pedient so to do, it may set the matter for hearing upon such notice to interested parties
as it may deem proper. The governing body may except such property from any particular
restriction or restrictions and permit the erection, alteration, reconstruction or enlarge-
ment of any building or structure thereon upon such terms and conditions as it deems proper
under the particular circumstances shown to exist, if it finds that the facts are such as to
entitle the petitioner to such an exception.
